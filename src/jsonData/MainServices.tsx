  <h1>Gibraltar Ship Registration</h1>
  <p>The Gibraltar Yacht Registry is an internationally recognized, high-quality registry providing an efficient and cost-effective service, making it an ideal choice for yacht owners who want the confidence of belonging to a British Register and flying the Red Ensign.</p>

  <p>Gibraltar’s key location at the entrance of the Mediterranean Sea and its quality Ship Register has made it an important commercial and maritime center. With Gibraltar being a common law jurisdiction as well, it is a very attractive jurisdiction for those considering the registration of Our vessel. It has a separate register for commercial and pleasure vessels, however, there is no size limit for pleasure vessels.</p>

  <h2>Benefits</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>Gibraltar is bound by all international conventions and agreements in relation to shipping and safety, which have been ratified by the United Kingdom, giving vessels registered in Gibraltar the same status as that of any other British registry.</li>
      <li>Changes in Gibraltar legislation now permit a wider range of individuals or corporate bodies to be qualified persons eligible to own a registerable ship.</li>
      <li>The GSR currently offers three types of registration: full registration; bareboat registration; and registration under construction.</li>
      <li>Generally, the GSR only accepts ships that are under 20 years of age. However, ships over 20 years may also be registered subject to a pre-registration survey.</li>
      <li>Full Registrations are valid for five years, bareboat registrations for up to two years and are all renewable.</li>
      <li>One special feature of the Gibraltar Register is the strict security for mortgagees since no ship will be de-registered without the mortgage being discharged first or without the mortgagees’ consent.</li>
      <li>In order to register on Gibraltar’s ship registry, owners must be British Citizens, British Dependent Territories citizens, British Overseas citizens, or EU or EEA nationals or companies registered within the EU or EEA, and have a majority interest in the vessel’s ownership.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Benefits (Continued)</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>The yacht will fly the defaced British flag (Red Ensign) together with the international recognition, protection, and prestige that comes with it.</li>
      <li>The ability to seek assistance from any of the British embassies and consulates worldwide where the vessel may be situated.</li>
      <li>Legal title of yacht ownership on registration or transfer of ownership is straightforward.</li>
      <li>All vital details concerning the yacht are contained in the Register and in the Certificate of British Registry (‘Blue Book’).</li>
      <li>The Register is a public record, open to inspection by interested third parties, such as buyers and/or potential lenders, offering security as to title.</li>
      <li>The Register enables the owner to dispose of the yacht easily in a cost-effective and timely manner.</li>
      <li>All legal mortgages are required to be registered, enabling interested parties to ascertain from this public record whether a yacht is free from encumbrances or registered liens.</li>

<h1>Estonia Fund Management Companies</h1>
<p>
  The main and permanent work of a fund management company is to manage the assets of a fund established as a company or a contractual fund. A management company may manage several funds. Alongside fund management, the management company may provide the following services:
</p>
<ol> 
  <li>Managing a securities portfolio within the meaning of the Securities Markets Act;</li>
  <li>Investment advice;</li>
  <li>Holding fund units or shares for clients;</li>
  <li>Fund management services within the meaning of the Investment Funds Act for funds whose assets it does not manage.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  A license is needed to operate as a fund manager, and this is issued and can be withdrawn by Finantsinspektsioon.
</p>
<h2>The operating form for a fund manager</h2>
<ol> 
<li>
  A fund management company is a business whose main work is to manage investment funds or securities portfolios. Fund management means managing the issuance of a fund’s shares or units, deciding the investment of the fund’s assets, keeping accounts of the fund’s assets, and conducting other operations directly related to these activities. A management company may manage several funds.
</li>
<li>
  The operations of fund managers are regulated by the Investment Funds Act. The law requires public investment funds, including pension funds, to have an operating license as a fund manager, and this is issued by Finantsinspektsioon. Operating licenses are also needed by fund managers that want to manage euro funds and large-scale alternative investment funds.
</li>
<li>
  To manage a small fund, the fund manager should apply for an operating license as a small fund manager or register its activities with Finantsinspektsioon. Small fund managers can only manage non-public investment funds, meaning Our business is primarily aimed at professional investors.
</li>
<li>
  A management company of an unlicensed small fund that does not wish to apply to Finantsinspektsioon for an operating license as a small fund manager must register its activities with Finantsinspektsioon. Finantsinspektsioon’s supervision over registered unlicensed small fund managers is limited to the registration process and later collection of statistical reporting.
</li>
</ol> 
<h2>Cross-border fund management companies</h2>
<p>
  Within the European Union, fund management companies established in one member state have the right to offer investment funds in other member states. Ordinary investors can publicly be offered regulated euro funds (UCITS) internationally, while professional investors can non-publicly be offered alternative investment funds (AIF, EuVECA). Investment funds offered internationally in Estonia must follow the regulations of the European Union directives in Our operations, and must also follow the rules in the legislation of the Republic of Estonia, primarily the Investment Fund Act.
</p>
<h2>Applying for an operating license as a fund manager</h2>
<ol>
<li>
  To apply for an operating license, the members of the management of the fund manager being established submit a written application to Finantsinspektsioon and the documents and data required by the Investment Funds Act.
</li>
<li>
  The decision to issue an operating license or to refuse it is taken by Finantsinspektsioon within two months after all the necessary documentation and data have been received, and not later than six months after the application for the operating license has been received.
</li>
<li>The fee for applying for an operating license as a fund manager is 1000 euros.</li>

  <h1>Guernsey Fiduciary License</h1>
  <h2>Personal Fiduciary License</h2>
  <p>Guernsey is a leading international fiduciary center with more than 50 years’ experience supplying trust and corporate services to clients from around the globe. It was one of the first centers in the world to establish a system of licensing and supervising its trust and corporate services providers via the Regulation of Fiduciaries, Administration Businesses and Company Directors (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law 200.</p>
  <p>A personal fiduciary license can only be granted to an individual and authorizes the holder to carry out a restricted range of fiduciary activities. Those include acting as a company director, as trustee (but not as a sole trustee), and as executor of a will or administrator of an estate and as a foundation official for foundations. Licences are granted to entities and individuals who meet the minimum criteria for licensing set out in Schedule 1 of the Law. Licensees are required to meet the criteria on an on-going basis.</p>
  
  <h3>Personal Fiduciary License Application</h3>
  <p>The license application pack must contain:</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Application form and supporting documentation</li>
      <li>Application fee</li>
      <li>Personal Questionnaire (“OPQ”) and Online Appointment ("OA")</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Full Fiduciary License – Corporate</h2>
  <p>A full fiduciary license can only be granted to a company or a partnership, and authorises all regulated fiduciary activities. Applicable applications for full fiduciary license include:</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Full fiduciary license – single company</li>
      <li>Full fiduciary license – single partnership</li>
      <li>Full fiduciary license – more than one company or partnership</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Applicants are advised to refer to further relevant Rules and Codes of Practice which have been made by the Commission, accessible from 'Legislation and Guidance' in the Fiduciary Supervision section of the GFSC website.</p>
  
  <h2>Joint Fiduciary License</h2>
  <p>The Financial Services Commission (Fees) Regulations allow applications for full fiduciary licensees to be submitted jointly (i.e., joint license applications) by:</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Companies which are in the same ownership and have common staff, procedures, and clients; or</li>
      <li>Any other combination of person or unincorporated bodies permitted by the Commission to make a joint application.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Applicants for a full fiduciary license for more than one company or partnership, or existing full fiduciary licensees wishing to add a joint fiduciary licensee to Our full fiduciary license, should use the Application Form for more than one company or partnership. Joint applicants must nominate one of the parties as the lead applicant.</p>
  <p>Where an applicant for a full fiduciary licensee is ultimately owned by a trust, prior to licensing, the Commission will require an undertaking from each trustee of the trust that it will not add or exclude any beneficiaries, appoint any co-trustees, retire, or sell transfer distribute or otherwise dispose of any shares in the full fiduciary licensee without the Commission's prior consent.

  <h1>Isle of Man Designated Business</h1>
  <p>Following comments from the IMF report in 2009, the Council of Ministers considered proposals put forward by the then Chief Secretary’s Office (now the Cabinet Office) to place responsibility on the Isle of Man Financial Services Authority (“the Authority") for the oversight of the adherence of certain businesses and professions (“Designated Businesses”) to the Island’s anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism legislation (“AML/CFT legislation”).</p>
  <p>Designated Businesses are also commonly referred to as Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions or “DNFBPs”.</p>
  <p>Designated businesses are registered and overseen by the Authority for AML/CFT compliance only –they retain Our current status with the various bodies (if any) responsible for Our wider business, competence or other matters, such as the Isle of Man Law Society, the ICAEW, ACCA, CIMA, the Office of Fair Trading etc.</p>

  <h2>Registration Policy</h2>
  <p>The Authority’s General Registration Policy ("the Registration Policy") sets out the criteria that applicants must satisfy to be successful in the registration of Our business. The Authority will not register a business where it feels that the applicant, including the persons associated with it, are not fit and proper to undertake the designated business.</p>
  <p>The fit and proper test is both an initial test at the time of registration and a continuing test in relation to the compliance with AML/CFT legislation of designated business.</p>
  <p>It should be noted that the fit and proper test for designated businesses is much narrower than the test for the Authority’s licenseholders.</p>
  <p>Once registered, a designated business must advise the Authority of any changes in its circumstances, within 14 days of the change. The changes that should be notified include any changes to the information submitted at registration such as contact details or details of those charged with the governance of the business.</p>
  <p>Each year, a registered designated business is required to submit an annual return. This is made available on the online portal from the 1 October of each year and must be submitted by 1 November of that year. If the annual return is not submitted by 1 November, the Authority will issue a civil penalty to the business in line with the Designated Businesses (Civil Penalties) Order 2015.</p>
  <p>At present, the Authority has delegated its oversight powers to the following professional bodies:</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales</li>
      <li>Association of Chartered Certified Accountants</li>
      <li>Isle of Man Law Society</li>

    <p>
      The fit and proper test is an initial test (at licensing) and a continuing test (in the ongoing conduct of the regulated activities).

      One characteristic of support PFS is that we do not as such exercise a financial activity themselves but act as subcontractors of operational functions on behalf of other financial professionals.
    </p>
    <h2>Legal Requirements and Authorization Procedure for Support Professionals of the Financial Sector (“Support PFS”)</h2>
    <p>
      The legal requirements that must be met and the procedure that must be followed in order to obtain an authorization as support PFS are laid down in Articles 13 to 23 of the Law of 5 April 1993 on the financial sector (“LFS”).
    </p>
    <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Legal form: An authorization as support PFS may only be granted to legal persons in the form of a public entity or a commercial company.</li>
      <li>Capital base: Support PFS shall prove that we have a subscribed and fully paid-up share capital of not less than EUR 50,000. Depending on the category of support PFS for which the authorization is sought, the required minimum share capital may amount to up to EUR 370,000.</li>
      <li>Central administration and infrastructure: An applicant shall prove that its central administration and its registered office are located in Luxembourg.</li>
      <li>Shareholders: Natural and legal persons are allowed as shareholders or members in support PFS, provided that we are previously authorized by the CSSF.</li>
      <li>Professional standing and experience: In order to obtain authorization, the members of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies and the shareholders or members with a qualifying holding shall prove Our professional standing.</li>
      <li>External audit: The support PFS shall entrust the audit of its accounting documents to one or several réviseurs d’entreprises agréés (approved statutory auditors) who have adequate professional experience.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <p>
      The authorization as a specialized PFS is granted by the Minister responsible for the CSSF, i.e. the Minister of Finance, upon written application and following an investigation of the application file by the CSSF. The CSSF verifies whether the conditions laid down in the LFS are fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to simplify administrative burdens, the CSSF encourages applicants to first transmit Our application files to the CSSF before filing the formal application request with the Minister of Finance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The authorization is granted for an unlimited period of time provided the support PFS complies at all times with the applicable legal requirements. Upon receipt of the authorization, the support PFS may immediately start to carry on business.

    <h1>Malta Company Service Providers</h1>
    <p>
      Recently, Malta has enacted new regulations to regulate company service providers providing services in Malta. This is in order to implement Act 36 of EU Directive 2005/60/EU on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing, with respect to company service providers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Act defines company service providers as any natural or legal person which by way of business provides any of the following services to third parties:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Incorporation of companies and other legal entities;</li>
      <li>Acting as or arranging for another person to act as director or secretary of a company or a similar position in other legal entities;</li>
      <li>Provision of a registered office or other related services for a company or other legal entity.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Registration of a Company Service Provider</h2>
    <p>
      Any person resident or operating from Malta who acts as a company service provider shall be required to be registered with the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), with the exception of those persons who possess a warrant to act as an advocate, notary, legal procurator, or accountant and persons authorized to act as a trustee in Malta.
    </p>
    <h2>Requirements of a Company Service Provider</h2>
    <p>
      A company service provider is required to be a fit and proper person, as determined by the MFSA, to provide the services concerned. In the case of legal persons, the activities of the legal person include acting as a company service provider, and the directors must be at least two in number, following the four eyes principle. The direct or indirect ultimate beneficial owners that own or control at least 25% of the shares or voting rights or otherwise exercise control over the management of the company are also required to be fit and proper persons. If a company is not incorporated in Malta, it should be incorporated in a reputable jurisdiction.

    <h1>Malta Investment Service Providers</h1>
    <p>
      Over the last two decades, Malta has established itself as an innovative and reliable financial services center, hosting a variety of financial services businesses and structures including fund managers, fund administrators, forex brokers, payment services providers, investment advisors, and insurance principals. The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) is responsible for the licensing, regulation, and supervision of investment services providers operating in and from Malta and is the Island’s single regulator for financial services. Malta’s appeal is also enhanced by its highly skilled workforce, multilingualism, extensive tax treaty network, and reliable IT infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MFSA is responsible for the licensing and supervision of entities providing investment services in or from Malta. The regulated entities would be licensed to provide investment services in relation to those financial instruments (for example shares, bonds) listed in Our license.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MFSA will only issue an investment services license if it is satisfied that the applicant is a fit and proper person to provide the investment service concerned and that the applicant will comply with and observe at all times all the rules applicable to the license holder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept of 'fit and proper' is a fundamental regulatory concept. This is a rigorous test which requires senior staff and potential and existing licensees to demonstrate competence, integrity, and solvency, i.e., we have sufficient capital, in all Our dealings. This concept needs to be practiced both at the licensing stage and on an ongoing basis thereafter.
    </p>
    <h2>Different Types of Investment Services</h2>
    <p>
      “Investment services” is a general term used to describe a whole range of activities related to investments in financial instruments. Typically, the most common forms of investment services are the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The provision of investment advice whereby investors are provided with personal recommendations on the investments products that would be suitable for them (also known as an advisory service);</li>
      <li>The purchase or sale of financial products on an execution-only basis (therefore without receiving investment advice); or</li>
      <li>The provision of portfolio management services (collective or discretionary).</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>MiFID II Licensing and Authorization</h2>
    <p>
      The provision of MiFID II services, referred to as Investment Services, in or from Malta is a licensable activity, requiring the attainment of an Investment Services License in terms of the Act and subsequent regulations which transpose EU Directives such as MiFID II and AIFMD.
    </p>
    <p>
      A MiFID II License is issued only if the MFSA is satisfied that the applicant is a ‘fit and proper’ person to provide the investment service(s) concerned, and that the applicant will comply with and observe any Investment Services Rules and Regulations made under the Act as applicable to the license holder. The concept of ‘fit and proper’ is a fundamental regulatory concept. This is a rigorous test which requires senior staff, both at licensing stage and on an ongoing basis thereafter, to demonstrate solvency, competence, and integrity in all Our dealings.

    <h1>Portfolio Managers and Trustees</h1>
    <p>
      Portfolio managers are persons who are eligible to accept assets belonging to others on the basis of a power of attorney, and who carry out this activity on a commercial basis, or who manage the assets of collective investment schemes or occupational pension schemes below the defined thresholds. Portfolio managers require a license from FINMA before we commence Our commercial activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same applies to trustees, who on a commercial basis manage or hold a separate fund for the benefit of the beneficiaries or for a specified purpose based on the instrument creating a trust. Trustees also require a license from FINMA before we commence Our commercial activities.
    </p>
    <h2>Licensing Requirements</h2>
    <p><strong>Portfolio managers</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Be legally classified as either a sole proprietorship, a commercial enterprise, or a cooperative and entered as such in the commercial register.</li>
      <li>Be suitably organized with adequate risk management and internal controls.</li>
      <li>Have sufficient equity capital or securities.</li>
      <li>Describe Our business activity including precise details of Our operations and geographic layout in the relevant documents.</li>
      <li>Provide proof of affiliation to an SO, thus confirming we are supervised by a supervisory organization.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
      <li>Be legally classified as either a sole proprietorship, a commercial enterprise, or a cooperative and entered as such in the commercial register.</li>
      <li>Be suitably organized with adequate risk management and internal controls.</li>
      <li>Have sufficient equity capital or securities.</li>
      <li>Describe Our business activity including precise details of Our operations and geographic layout in the relevant documents.</li>
      <li>Provide proof of affiliation to an SO, thus confirming we are supervised by a supervisory organization.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Licensing Process</h2>
    <p>
      The licensing process for portfolio managers and trustees is conducted solely on an electronic basis via the survey and application platform (EHP). All forms and information for submitting an application are available there.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 1: Self-registration on the EHP</strong></p>
    <p>
      To gain access to the EHP, portfolio managers must perform the self-registration on the FINMA website. Once the self-registration has been verified by FINMA, the EHP can be accessed via the FINMA portal using two-factor authentication.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 2: Preparing application</strong></p>
    <p>
      The application template is stored on the EHP in the form of an input screen. More information can be found on the EHP.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 3: Transmitting the license application to a supervisory organization</strong></p>
    <p>
      Portfolio managers and trustees are not supervised by FINMA directly, but instead by a FINMA-authorized supervisory organization (SO). FINMA publishes a list of supervisory organizations authorized by FINMA. As part of the licensing process, portfolio managers/trustees select one of the authorized SOs, contact them, and subsequently send them the license application including attachments via the EHP.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 4: Checking of the license application and confirmation from the SO</strong></p>
    <p>
      The SO verifies the applicant’s affiliation to its organization on the basis of the license application. When verification is complete, the SO provides the portfolio manager or trustee with written confirmation of Our affiliation. The SO sends the relevant confirmation document to the applicant via the EHP or by other means.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 5: Transmitting the application and SO confirmation to FINMA</strong></p>
    <p>
      Once applicants receive confirmation from the SO, we should send this with the license application to FINMA via the EHP. FINMA will process the application once it has been formally submitted in full, i.e. including the SO confirmation and enclosures. Portfolio managers and trustees may still be required to send additional information in a subsequent step. Any additional information should be submitted via the EHP.

      Financial advisers give advice about financial planning, investing, insurance, and other financial services. Financial advisers look at your personal circumstances and your financial plans and recommend products to help you meet your needs. There are two types of financial advisers:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Independent financial advisers (IFAs)</strong> give unbiased advice about the whole range of financial products from all the different companies available.</li>
      <li><strong>Restricted advisers</strong> give advice on a limited range of products. We may specialize in one area, for example, pensions, or we may only offer advice on products offered by a limited number of companies.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All financial advisers must have the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Level 4 or above of the national Qualifications and Credit Framework.</li>
      <li>A Statement of Professional Standing (SPS). This means we have signed up to a code of ethics and have completed at least 35 hours of professional training each year.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Independent financial advisers (IFAs), like the banks and companies that sell financial products, are regulated by the FCA. In order to register with the FCA, financial advisers need to have a Certificate of Financial Planning (Cert FP).
    </p>
    <p>
      Individuals and businesses consult IFAs on many matters including investment, retirement planning, insurance, protection, and mortgages (or other loans). IFAs also advise on some tax and legal matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      IFA Network is an association of IFAs. All financial advisers in the UK must either be authorized or exempt under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Membership of an IFA Network qualifies an IFA as being exempt from regulation. The IFA Network is then responsible for the advice and regulatory compliance of its members.

Investment management involves the professional management of various financial securities and assets belonging to an investor for the purpose of earning maximum benefits. An investment manager is an individual who manages investor finance and focuses on yielding future benefits for the investor. Investment managers manage investment portfolios and operate under the government’s securities legislation. Investment managers are also known as ‘fund managers’. The term fund or investment manager refers to both an individual who helps direct investment management decisions, and institutions providing financial services.

    <h2>Investment License in the UK</h2>

      Credit unions and banks are together referred to as “credit institutions”. In many cases, particularly as regards prudential requirements, we are subject to the same rules. The National Bank of the country acts as the regulator of the financial market in the Czech Republic. The advantage of conducting banking activities in the Czech Republic is the presence of the process of passportization.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procedure for obtaining banking license starts from the moment of submitting application by the applicant. The main requirement for foreign companies is the establishment of Our own bank in the country. The branch should be acting and refer to the organizational and legal form of LLC or JSC. The legal entity is also obliged to register settlement account and contribute the authorized capital in the amount corresponding to the selected organizational and legal form. Minimum regulatory capital of the bank in the Czech Republic equals to 500 million CZK (approximately 18 million 700 thousand EUR).
    </p>
    <p>
      Consideration of the application takes no more than 8 months from the date of delivery of the package of documents to the commission for financial regulation. The certificate has unlimited period of validity, however, annual renewal of the permission is required.

      The main job of a credit institution, or bank, is to take in deposits of money and other repayable funds from the public and to issue loans on its own account or to finance them in other ways. To create a credit institution, an activity license needs to be applied for from Finantsinspektsioon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only businesses that take in deposits from the public have the right to use the name ‘bank’. The only businesses established in Estonia that are allowed to take in deposits from the public are those that have a license from Finantsinspektsioon to operate as a credit institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Applying for an operating license as a credit institution: To receive an operating license, the members of the management of the business being set up or operating must submit a written application to Finantsinspektsioon and the documents and data listed in the Credit Institutions Act. When a bank is founded the share capital paid in must be at least five million euros. Only real sums paid in may be indicated as equity capital of the bank. The bank cannot be founded with publicly subscribed shares. The procedures for issuing an operating license to a bank take 6-12 months. The decision to issue an operating license or to refuse it is taken by Finantsinspektsioon within six months after all the necessary documentation and data have been received, and not later than 12 months after the application for the operating license has been received. The fee for applying for an operating license as a credit institution is 1500 euros.
    </p>
    <p>
      Providing cross-border services in Estonia: A credit institution from an EEA state that wants to start providing cross-border services in Estonia informs Finantsinspektsioon through the financial supervision authority of that state, indicating the transactions and operations that it intends to start providing. A credit institution from an EEA state may start providing cross-border services in Estonia once the notification has been sent to Finantsinspektsioon by the financial supervision authority of the EEA state.

      Under the EU Directive 2008/48/EC, licenses granted under the Financial Services (Moneylending) Act fall under the scope of the Financial Services (Consumer Credit) Act 2011 (the Act). The CEO of the GFSC is the director appointed for the purposes of the Act and is responsible for firm and individuals’ compliance with the conduct of business rules within the Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Act applies to firms who:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Grant or promise to grant credit to consumers; or</li>
      <li>Act as intermediaries in connection with agreements granting credit made between a creditor and consumer.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If you are providing consumer credit as defined in the Act, you are required to comply with the provisions in the Act. The Act applies to loans between EUR 200 and EUR 75,000 if these do not relate to the purchase of property. Some overdrafts and overrunning are also within the scope of this Act. Credit Institutions and branches in Gibraltar do not have to be separately licensed under the Moneylenders Act but must comply with conduct of business requirements in the Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the Government of Gibraltar notifies the GFSC of licenses issued under the Financial Services (Moneylending) Act, entities and individuals who fall within the scope of the Act will receive a letter. The GFSC requires confirmation that the firm does or does not comply with the provisions of the Act. Firms providing consumer credit fall within the definition of financial services business as set out in Section 9 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2015 (POCA), and hence are required to comply with the provisions set out in POCA.

    <h1>Malta Credit Institutions</h1>
    <p>
      Credit institutions are entities licensed to operate under the Banking Act, Chapter 371 of the Laws of Malta. According to the Banking Act, a credit institution can undertake a number of activities which are specified in the same Act. The taking of deposits from retail customers is the licensable activity that distinguishes a credit institution from other licensed entities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malta’s strong financial sector is underpinned by the island’s banking industry that remained stable amidst the past decade of financial turmoil thanks to prudent management and highly liquid Balance Sheets. As a full EU member state, the jurisdiction benefits from compliance with EU directives, a fact that has helped to attract foreign banks to establish operations in Malta.
    </p>
    <p>
      The island allows for banks to offer credit facilities, having applied for a license as an authorized credit institution. Credit institutions authorized in Malta operate under the Banking Act (Chapter 371), permitting credit institutions to accept and hold deposits from retail or institutional customers and are able to undertake actions such as offering credit as loans or overdraft facilities, financial leasing, money broking, issuing of electronic money, and foreign exchange, amongst other services.
    </p>
    <h2>Regulatory Bodies for Credit Institutions</h2>
    <p>
      In order to offer such credit facilities, banks must abide by strict regulation as well as meet certain requirements on an ongoing basis. Malta has one regulator for all financial services, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). It is the MFSA that will consider applications for credit institutions as the local competent authority but will then liaise with the European Central Bank (ECB) in order for any license to be issued. Large credit institutions deemed to be of critical importance to the national and/or European banking sector are not only regulated by the MFSA but are also directly regulated by the European Central Bank.
    </p>
    <h2>The Depositor Compensation Scheme and Credit Institutions</h2>
    <p>
      As part of the requirements to be licensed as a credit institution, entities are required to contribute to the Depositor Compensation Scheme. The Scheme refers to a fund set up as a contingency for insolvent banks licensed by the MFSA under the Malta Banking Act within the European Economic Area (“EEA”), that are not able to provide payment to depositors, thus ensuring the stability of the financial system in Malta. Compensation for deposits at credit institutions is capped at a maximum of EUR 100,000 per depositor held within that credit institution. Additional compensation of up to EUR 500,000 may be awarded in special cases.
    </p>
    <h2>License requirements</h2>
    <p>
      In order to obtain a credit institution license in Malta, the applicant must contribute and maintain own funds as a minimum share capital of EUR 5 million, and a minimum of two people must manage the operation of the Malta credit institution. Further functions will be required to be carried out either by additional staff or through outsourcing arrangements – the MFSA will need to be convinced that the proposed structure is adequate to the planned business model and volumes. Applications, where the credit institution will be at least partly owned by a licensed bank or financial institution, tend to be preferred, although it is possible to demonstrate alternative means of soundness and stability. All applications are submitted to the MFSA and must include a business plan, demonstrating how liquidity and minimum capital requirements will be met and maintained, as well as due diligence exercises and regulatory compliance.

    <h1>Switzerland Central Mortgage Bond Institute</h1>
    <p>
      Special institution set up to issue mortgage bonds and grant long-term loans to its affiliated banks. Two such institutions were established in Switzerland in 1930, namely the Central Mortgage Bond Institution of the Swiss Cantonal Banks and the Mortgage Bond Bank of the Swiss Mortgage Institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortgage bonds are debt securities used for the long-term financing of senior mortgage loans granted by banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Switzerland’s central mortgage bond institutions are supervised by FINMA on the basis of auditing and reporting conducted by licensed audit firms. Unlike conventional bonds, Swiss mortgage bonds offer extensive protection by law. The issuer and the lending banks are liable with Our own assets, while the borrowers are also liable towards the banks with Our mortgaged properties. This chain of security is unique worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      FINMA is responsible for supervising both of these institutions on an ongoing basis for which it relies largely on the auditing and reporting conducted by external audit firms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audit firms are commissioned in particular with:
      <ol>
        <li>Financial reporting rules</li>
        <li>Articles of association and regulatory requirements</li>
        <li>Legal requirements for issuing mortgage bonds and granting loans</li>

    <h1>United Kingdom Building Societies</h1>
    <p>
      A building society is a financial institution owned by its members as a mutual organization. Building societies offer banking and related financial services, especially savings and mortgage lending. We are similar to credit unions in organization, though few enforce a common bond. However, rather than promoting thrift and offering unsecured and business loans, the purpose of a building society is to provide home mortgages to members. Borrowers and depositors are society members, setting policy and appointing directors on a one-member, one-vote basis. Building societies often provide other retail banking services, such as current accounts, credit cards, and personal loans.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the United Kingdom, building societies actively compete with banks for most consumer banking services, especially mortgage lending and savings accounts, and regulations permit up to half of Our lending to be funded by debt to non-members, allowing societies to access wholesale bond and money markets to fund mortgages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The requirements for establishing a building society are set out in Section 5 and Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Building Societies Act 1986. To establish a new society, ten or more persons must agree on a memorandum setting out the purpose (or principal purpose) and the extent of the powers of the intended society, in terms which comply with the 1986 Act and on rules for the regulation of the society which comply with the Act. All those persons (or at least 10), and the intended secretary, must then sign four copies of the memorandum and the rules and send them to the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) for consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are strict capital requirements for setting up a new society - it must have adequate capital resources commensurate with the nature and scale of its business and the risks inherent in its business. It must maintain own funds of at least £1 million. The new organization would also have to have a proper business plan, funding and lending plans, and robust information technology, etc.

    <h1>United Kingdom Credit Unions</h1>
    <p>
      A credit union is a financial co-operative which provides savings, loans, and a range of services to its members. It is owned and controlled by the members. The first credit union in Britain began trading in 1964, and over the last 50 years, credit unions have grown to provide loans and savings to more than 1.2 million people across England, Scotland, and Wales. Credit unions are owned by the people who use Our services, and not by external shareholders or investors. So the emphasis is always on providing the best service to members – not maximizing profits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Credit unions are dual-regulated, which means that we are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). The services that credit unions can offer include:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Deposit-taking</li>
      <li>Savings</li>
      <li>Lending</li>
    </ol>

This is in accordance with Articles 29-7 and 29-8 of the Law of 5 April 1993 on the financial sector (“LFS”).
    </p>
    <p>
      Article 29-8(2) of the LFS permits credit institutions, investment firms, or market operators operating a trading venue to conduct data reporting services, provided we can verify Our compliance with Sub-section 4 of the LFS (Articles 29-7 to 29-15). These services should be included in Our authorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      DRSPs are characterized by three exceptions compared to other categories of financial sector professionals. Firstly, we are not subject to shareholder requirements (Article 18(20) of the LFS) and capital base requirements (Article 20(1) of the LFS).

      The regulations in the area of payment system institutions apply – to varying extents – to entities that are authorized or registered to perform the activities of payment institutions, electronic money institutions, electronic money issuers or small-scale payment service providers. Some of these institutions are subject to similar regulation as banks and credit unions. Banks and credit unions may also provide payment services under conditions stipulated in the act regulating the activities of banks or credit unions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Electronic money becomes a necessity progressively as the general development of society. Due to interactive wallets, you can pay for any product or service without leaving your office or home. A certificate is not required for user management of a private virtual account.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in the event that a legal entity plans to use the interactive currency continuously to conduct business or intends to create its own payment system, it must obtain a license for the use of electronic money.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need a license of the Payment Institution to build your international payment services business, the Czech Republic is the best solution for your payment system and you are on the right site. The Czech license of the Payment Institution is a European license and gives the right to work throughout the European Union, without any limits in attracting clients from all over the world. And your employees can be where you decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Czech Republic regulates the activities of persons authorized to provide payment services and issue electronic money, according to the Act number 284/2009 Sb. and directive number 141/2011 Sb. Czech legislation and regulations regarding Payment Institutions fully comply with all EU directives, so the passportization in other EU countries after obtaining a Czech license is possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The license of the payment institution is granted by the Czech National Bank. The license may be issued subject to the following conditions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A legal entity is a resident of the Czech Republic.</li>
      <li>The registered and head office is located in the Czech Republic.</li>
      <li>Share capital is from 70,000 Euro.</li>
      <li>The business plan is available.</li>
      <li>Transparency and compliance of the business model with regulations and international rules.</li>
      <li>Directors are reliable persons in terms of reasonable provision of payment services.</li>
      <li>Key persons are employees who are able to effectively do business on payment services provision, who are competent and are sufficiently experienced in terms of reasonable and careful provision of payment services.</li>
    </ol>

      The small-scale payment services provider
    </p>
    <p>
      The small-scale payment services provider has the right to provide payment services as well as the payment institution, but has two main limitations.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The maximum average monthly turnover of 3 million euros at the rate of the last 12 months. Those must not exceed 36 million euros for 12 months.</li>
      <li>Can provide services only in the Czech Republic. However, this does not prohibit customers from all over the world. And company employees can work remotely.</li>
    </ol>

      Electronic money Institution license
    </p>
    <p>
      The license of the E-Money Institution - EMI or the Electronic Money Issuer includes all the capabilities of the Payment Institution. The main difference between the two types of payment service providers is that electronic institutions can issue electronic money. Electronic money is the digital equivalent of cash stored on an electronic device or remotely on a server. Unlike the Payment Institution, the Electronic Money Institution (EMI), issuing electronic money in exchange for money, provides financial services that are unlimited in time, without known payment directions, with the possibility of crushing and accumulating funds. The issuer undertakes the obligation to pay money in exchange for electronic money at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A company registered as a Small-Scale Electronic Money Institution is entitled to provide a full range of services, as well as the Electronic Money Institution (EMI), which is the most complete license of all types of payment system licenses, but with the limitations specified above. The Small-scale electronic money issuers license has 3 main limitations:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The issuer has the right to issue electronic money, provided that the average amount of electronic money issued by it in circulation over the past 6 months does not exceed the amount corresponding to 5,000,000 euros.</li>
      <li>The Issuer has the right to provide other payment services not related to electronic money. But the maximum average monthly volume of these payment services should not exceed 3,000,000 euros for the last 12 months. Those must not exceed 36 million euros for 12 months.</li>
      <li>Can provide services only in the Czech Republic. However, this does not prohibit customers from all over the world. And company employees can work remotely.</li>

    <p>Electronic Money (E–money) is electronically, including magnetically, stored monetary value, represented by an issuer, accepted by a person other than the electronic money issuer. Types of E-money include pre-paid cards and electronic pre-paid accounts for use online.</p>
    <p>The authorisation of E-money Issuers falls within the scope of the Financial Services Act 2019. E-money Issuers should ensure that we comply with all subsidiary legislation to the Act. An E-money Issuer can issue and redeem E-money through a proper establishment or through an Agent or Distributor.</p>
    <p>There are two types of E-money Issuers:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Authorized E-money Issuer; and</li>
      <li>Registered E-money Issuer.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Both types of E-money Issuers must meet certain standards and provide the necessary information so that the GFSC can monitor and supervise them effectively. Applicants should note that Registered E-money Issuers cannot passport Our services.</p>
    <p>Applicants should submit an application pack with all relevant documents. An authorized E-money Issuer is required to hold an initial and ongoing capital of:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>€350,000; or</li>
      <li>2.2%* of the average outstanding electronic money (as projected at application), whichever the highest.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A small or registered E-money Issuer is required to hold an initial and ongoing capital of 2.2% of the average outstanding electronic money.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the Regulations, every E-money Issuer must satisfy the GFSC that it has adequate arrangements in place to safeguard the funds of customers received in exchange for E-money issued, and prevent the use of these funds for the E-money Issuer’s own account.</p>
    <p>Additionally, an E-money Issuer that holds customer funds must keep such records and accounts as are necessary to enable them at any time and immediately distinguish funds held for one customer from another and from the funds of the e-money Institution.</p>

    <p>Progress in technology has contributed to the development of a new kind of payment instrument - electronic money.</p>
    <p>This may be in the form of value stored on a technical device such as a chip card or a computer. Electronic money (e-Money) can be best described as a digital form of cash since it has many of the characteristics of cash.</p>
    <p>Customers buy the electronic equivalent of coins and notes. The customer, in effect, has exchanged cash for another means of payment. Instead of using a debit card (which requires a bank account) or a credit card (which requires a contract agreement) the customer has purchased a non-cash means of payment, which can be used in much the same way as cash or other forms of card payment but without the requirement of third party authorization.</p>
    <p><strong>Benefits of electronic money:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Instant payment</li>
      <li>Offers higher payment security</li>
      <li>Better customer convenience</li>

    <h1>Luxembourg Payment Institutions/ Electronic Money Institutions/ AISP</h1>
    <p>Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) and Payment Institutions (PI) are instrumental in making e-commerce and electronic payment possible across EEA and the Single European Payments Area (SEPA). The electronic payments market is growing at a rapid pace with businesses and consumers relying increasingly on electronic payments. The provision of such services is regulated by EU Directives and enforced by Member States’ regulators.</p>
    <p>The services offered by Payment Institutions can vary from the provision of payment infrastructures to customers (e.g., for services industries) to services enabling payments between individuals. It also includes facilitation of secure credit and debit card transactions, both nationally and internationally. Other services include automatic currency conversion in sales outlets, the processing of electronic gift tokens or money-off vouchers, as well as recharging mobile phone pre-paid cards.</p>
    <p>In addition to issuing electronic money, EMIs are also permitted to supply all services of Payment Institutions, to grant loans (under certain conditions) linked to payment services, to supply operational services and other services closely linked to the issuing of electronic money or to the supply of payment services. Entities with a banking license are automatically permitted to perform PI and EMI functions.</p>
    <p>No persons established in Luxembourg may provide payment services or issue electronic money without holding a written authorization as PI or EMI by the Minister responsible for the CSSF (Articles 6 and 24-2 of the PSL).</p>
    <h2>Authorisation Procedure</h2>
    <p>Before taking a formal decision to set up an EMI or PI in Luxembourg, prospective institutions often like to have an informational meeting with the supervisory authority, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF). Such meetings allow the financial services supervisory authority to immediately clarify regulatory aspects to the prospective institutions. PIs and EMIs are subject to initial assessment, which takes place in the form of a detailed application file to the CSSF, with a filing fee of EUR 15,000.</p>
    <p>The institution’s head office and central administration must be in Luxembourg. The Company must provide its services to the Luxembourg market and have an office and employees in Luxembourg.</p>
    <p>Following the delivery of the license, a letter is sent to the supervised entity explaining the various legal reporting to be submitted to the CSSF on a periodic basis. An annual lump sum fee of EUR 20,000 must also be paid to the regulator by PIs and EMIs.</p>
    <p>Luxembourg authorized PIs and EMIs may provide Our services in another EEA state, by using a “passport “for cross-border services, or by setting-up an establishment or branch in an EEA country. This is done through a regulatory notification procedure.</p>
    <p>Authorization may only be granted to a legal person incorporated under Luxembourg law, which must be established in the form of a public limited company (société anonyme – SA).</p>
    <p>The PSL Law requires a minimum capital of at least:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>EUR 20,000 – 125,000 for a Payment Institution, depending on the type of payment services.</li>
      <li>EUR 350,000 for an Electronic Money Institution.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In general, successful applications for PI and EMI licenses take between 4 – 12 months, depending on the complexity of the business and the quality of the application file.</p>

    <h1>Malta Electronic Money Institution License</h1>
    <p>The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) is the authority responsible for the licensing, regulation, and supervision of credit institutions, electronic money institutions, and financial institutions. The setting up of Electronic Money Institutions in Malta is regulated by the Financial Institutions Act and Financial Institutions Rules.</p>
    <p>Electronic Money Institutions are entitled to engage in any of the following activities:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>the provision of certain payment services;</li>
      <li>the granting of credit related to certain payment services. Provided that any such credit shall not be granted from the funds received in exchange for electronic money and held in accordance with the prescribed safeguarding requirements;</li>

    <p>EMIs based in Malta are allowed to outsource services subject to the MFSA’s evaluation on Our own merits.</p>
    <p>Once a license is obtained, the Electronic Money Institution would benefit from the right to passport such a license into other EU Member States and EEA countries by following some basic procedures of notification, thereby enabling the Electronic Money Institution to provide its services within the relevant Member States and/or EEA States either through the establishment of a branch or remotely, under the freedom to provide services.</p>

    <h1>Netherlands Electronic Money Institutions</h1>
    <p>An electronic money institution issues electronic money, for example in the shape of a gift card or a wristband you can use for paying at a festival. Electronic money institutions wishing to operate in the Netherlands must have a license or exemption from DNB. Exempt institutions are not supervised by DNB, but by the AFM.</p>
    <p>If you wish to become an electronic money institution in the Netherlands then you must prepare and submit an electronic money institution application to the Dutch regulator – the Dutch Central Bank, namely, the De Nederlandsche Bank NV (DNB), before you can offer such services, as an electronic money institution. The Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht) defines an electronic money institution as a party, not being a bank, that issues electronic money in exchange for funds with which payments can be made.</p>
    <p>As per Section 3:34 of the Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht), an electronic money institution is able to perform the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Provide services relating to the issuance of electronic money;</li>
      <li>Issue and manage other means of payments;</li>
      <li>Payment accounts. The user is able to place and withdraw cash on such accounts as well as use the account card to make a payment transaction, using the card to buy goods and services. Users are also able to set up direct debits standing orders as well as transferring funds;</li>
      <li>Merchant services. Holders of the payment institution license are able to provide merchant services. This can include acting as a master merchant and offering merchants the ability to accept card payments;</li>
      <li>Money remittance. Money remittance or transfer is another service payment institutions are able to offer. This service enables the payment service provider to enable users to make cross-border payments, internationally;</li>
      <li>Payment initiation services. Under this model, an initiator (i.e., a payment service provider under the payment institution license), subject to the user's consent, is able to initiate a payment directly from the user's bank account and transfer the amount directly to the merchant retailer’s bank account, removing the Visa and MasterCard networks from the payment process;</li>
      <li>Account information services. Under this permission, subject to the user's consent, a payment service provider is able to provide access to a user’s accounts and enable them to view consolidated account information in one place.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>License Application</h2>
    <p>As part of your electronic money institution license application in the Netherlands, you will be required to submit a number of documents, policies, and procedures, including a business plan, your safeguarding measures (how you will keep your client money separated and ring-fenced), your governance arrangements and risk management, your procedures for managing and handling security incidents and customer complaints, your security policy, and your measures against financial crime, including AML. These policy and procedural documents must be specific to your firm and adequately address key aspects as set out by the regulator.</p>
    <p>As part of your electronic money institution license application, you will need to provide details of your IT systems, including both core systems and any support systems. You will also be required to demonstrate that you have an operational presence in the Netherlands e.g. physical office and locally-based people.</p>
    <p>As part of your Authorized Electronic Money Institution license application, you will be required to provide the following information as part of your application:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Company details</li>
      <li>Programme of operations</li>
      <li>Business plan and financial forecasts</li>
      <li>A description of your business’s organization structure</li>
      <li>Evidence of your initial capital</li>
      <li>Details of client fund safeguarding</li>
      <li>Compliance & governance arrangements</li>
      <li>Procedure for monitoring, handling, and following up on security incidents and security-related customer complaints</li>
      <li>Processes for filing, monitoring, tracking, and restricting access to sensitive payment data</li>
      <li>Business continuity and recovery measures</li>
      <li>Collection of statistical data regarding performance, transaction, and fraud</li>
      <li>Security policy</li>
      <li>Risk assessment and mitigation measures including controls to manage your AML/CTF obligations</li>
      <li>Shareholder information</li>
      <li>Details of any outsourcing arrangements</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Dutch regulator must make a decision within three months of receiving a complete application. In reality, it takes around 4-5 months to obtain the license. If you are authorized as an electronic money institution in the Netherlands, you can provide your services as an electronic money provider across the rest of the countries within the European Economic Area without requiring additional licenses in those countries.</p>

    <h1>Netherlands Exchange Institutions</h1>
    <p>The Wft defines an exchange institution as one that pursues the business of performing exchange transactions. Exchange transaction is itself defined as:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>a currency exchange transaction,</li>
      <li>the payment of coins and banknotes upon presentation of a credit card or against delivery of a document as referred to in Section 1:5a (2), under g, of the Wft, such as paper cheques, including traveler's cheques, postal or money orders etc.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Pursuant to the Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht or Wft), an exchange institution may not pursue its business until and unless it has been authorized by DNB. To determine whether authorization is required, it must be decided whether the institution and its transactions qualify as an exchange office and, respectively, exchange transactions.</p>
    <p>Exchange institutions wishing to operate in the Netherlands must have a license or exemption from DNB. An authorized exchange institution may not perform payment services, such as money remittance.</p>
    <p>In principle, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) decides on an application for authorization of an exchange institution within 13 weeks. However, the actual consideration period depends on many factors. The quality and completeness of your application have a major bearing on the time required by DNB for assessment.</p>
    <p>An application for authorization as an exchange institution should be submitted via the Digitaal Loket Toezicht (DLT) of the Dutch Central Bank.</p>
    <p>De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) charges a fee for handling applications for authorization of exchange institutions.</p>

<h1>Netherlands Payment Institutions</h1>
<p>A payment service provider is one whose business it is to provide payment services, according to Section 1:1 of the Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht – Wft). These services must be provided to persons making payments (consumers) or parties using the payment services (retailers), or both. So a payment service provider acts as an intermediary between the two.</p>

<p>Payment service providers holding a license issued by DNB are referred to as payment institutions. Our license requirement is set out in Section 2:3a of the Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht – Wft).</p>

<p>Following the implementation of the revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU) (PSD2), there will be eight types of payment services requiring a license. We may be provided as a single service or in any combination. These are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Services enabling cash to be placed on a payment account as well as all the operations required for operating a payment account. These services enable users to pay cash (coins and banknotes) into a payment account held with the party offering the service.</li>
  <li>Services enabling cash to be placed on a payment account as well as all the operations required for operating a payment account. These services enable users to withdraw or transfer money from a payment account held with the party offering the service.</li>
  <li>Execution of payment transactions, including transfers of funds on a payment account with the user's payment service provider or with another payment service provider. These services enable users to execute payment transactions on the user's payment accounts as meant in the description of services 1 and 2 or on the user's payment account held with another payment service provider. This also includes services offering the possibility to withdraw or deposit cash using a cash dispenser or cash deposit machine, with the equivalent amount debited from or credited to a payment account.</li>
  <li>Execution of payment transactions where the funds are covered by a credit line for a payment service user. A credit line may include a situation in which the payment service provider advances the amount due.</li>
  <li>Issuing and/or acquiring of payment instruments. A payment instrument is a means or method to initiate a payment order, including a physical object, such as a credit card. Acquiring a payment instrument means the enterprise guarantees the settlement of transactions by means of an agreement concluded with the beneficiary, e.g. an online retailer. The acquiring entity handles payments to the beneficiary based on the payment orders received. Enterprises providing services to retailers, including online retailers, for the acceptance of payment instruments provide type 5 services.</li>
  <li>Money remittance. Money remittance services are involved if a payment institution receives funds from a payer for the sole purpose of transferring a corresponding amount either directly to a payee or to another payment service provider that pays the funds to the ultimate beneficiary. No payment account is created in the name of the payer.</li>
  <li>Payment initiation services. At a payment service user's request, a payment service provider initiates a payment order from an online payment account held with another payment service provider. For example, initiating an online purchase at a web shop on behalf of a consumer.</li>
  <li>Account information services. A payment services provider provides consolidated information on one or more payment accounts held by the payment service user by one or more payment service providers.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Licensing Procedure</h2>

<p>The payment institution must meet various criteria to be able to offer its services. These include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Demonstrating the reliability and suitability of policy makers</li>
  <li>The integrity of the company’s operations</li>
  <li>Controlled governance</li>
  <li>Surety of the funds</li>
  <li>Evaluation of the day-to-day policy makers</li>
  <li>Minimum equity and solvency requirements</li>
  <li>No Objection certificate</li>
</ol>

<p>This is about managing operational processes and business risks, such as safeguarding the funds of the payment institution’s clients. Policy and procedures, such as a client acceptance policy, transaction monitoring, a compliance charter, and a procedure for reporting irregular transactions need to be formulated. In most cases, a ‘risk management’ policy needs to be formulated and a risk & compliance officer needs to be appointed.</p>

<p>All the supporting documentation for the application then needs to be submitted to the DNB. The application form that must to be completed and signed serves as the basis. The DNB decides whether to grant a license within three months of receipt of a license application from a payment institution. Note that the three months only start once all the necessary documentation has been received. There are costs involved in applying for a license from the DNB.</p>

<p>When compiling the file, the implementation of specific policy and corresponding procedures in the payment institution is already a big step. Ensure these activities have actually been implemented by the company before the license is granted. Do not underestimate this process, because depending on the size of the organization, this step can be moderately to very resource intensive.</p>

<p>DNB charges a fee for considering applications for authorization. The fee applies regardless of whether it grants or dismisses the application or the applicant withdraws the application.</p>

<p>The amount of this one-off fee is EUR 6,800, as specified in the Financial Supervision Funding Act. DNB also charge payment institutions an annual fee to cover the costs of our regular supervision.</p>

    <h1>Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs)</h1>
    <p>
      A self-regulatory organization (SRO) is an entity such as a non-governmental organization, which has the power to create and enforce stand-alone industry and professional regulations and standards on its own. In the case of financial SROs, such as a stock exchange, the priority is to protect investors by establishing rules, regulations, and set standards of procedures that promote ethics, equality, and professionalism. Although SROs are private organizations, we are still subject to government-imposed regulation to a degree. However, the government does delegate some aspects of the industry oversight to self-regulatory organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Switzerland, these organizations are subject to FINMA supervision and regulate the activities of financial intermediaries attached to them, including wealth managers. The SRO makes sure that standards and legal obligations are abided by. Particular attention is paid to the fulfillment of obligations set by Swiss Anti-Money Laundering Act by SRO members.
    </p>
    <p>
      To become a member of an SRO, a wealth manager will normally need to provide a certificate or character, letters of reference, and a business plan. Additionally, we must possess relevant education and experience in the field. Depending on the SRO in question, intermediaries may have to meet additional criteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) states that financial intermediaries must become members of a self-regulatory organization (SRO) under civil law as a way of preventing money laundering.
    </p>
    <p>
      SROs are subject to supervision by FINMA, which recognizes and monitors them. FINMA recognizes an organization as an SRO if it:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>has a set of regulations which set out the AMLA due diligence requirements in detail for its members;</li>
      <li>monitors compliance with these regulations by affiliated financial intermediaries;</li>
      <li>can give a guarantee of irreproachable business activity and ensures that audit firms and other individuals tasked with implementing these controls meet the requirements in terms of proper business conduct, independence, and appropriate qualifications; and</li>
      <li>ensures that the audit firms and lead auditors tasked with implementing these controls meet the authorization requirements as defined in the AMLA.</li>

    <h1>United Kingdom Mutual Societies</h1>
    <p>
      A mutual society is an organization owned by its members. Profits are usually reinvested to help improve the service, rather than paid out to external shareholders as we would be in a public limited company (PLC).
    </p>
    <h2>Features of mutual societies</h2>
    <p>
      A mutual is owned exclusively by its customers, known as members, and run for Our benefit. So, unlike most financial services organizations, which are run as PLCs (Public Limited Companies), mutuals have no shareholders to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like other financial services providers, UK mutuals need to be authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutuals are big business. Today in the UK, we manage £125 billion in assets and have more than 30 million members.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annual controllers report must be sent to FCA once a year, within 4 months of the accounting reference date (the last day in your financial year). This must contain information about all your controllers.
    </p>
    <h2>Fees</h2>
    <p>
      Application fee of between £40 and £950, depending on whether you use model rules, use model rules with changes or freely draft your own rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annual fee of between £60 and £460, depending on the society’s total assets.
    </p>
    <h2>Mutuals Public Register</h2>

      The Mutuals Public Register is a public record of mutual societies registered by the Financial Conduct Authority (opens in a new tab). It has information for societies currently registered, and those no longer registered. The types of mutual societies include:

    <h1>Switzerland Foundation</h1>
    <p>
      Under Swiss law, a foundation is a segregated fund organized as a legal entity, dedicated to a specific purpose. A foundation has no members and does not embed in its legal form a charitable status with an automatic tax exemption.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Switzerland, to create a foundation, founders must submit notarized legal documents. The foundation charter is a deed poll by the founder(s) and contains: The name of the founders. Attributed funds or property.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minimum capitalization to register a Swiss foundation is CHF 20,000 which can take the form of cash or other asset types. The foundation is run by a board with at least one board member in Switzerland.
    </p>
    <h2>TYPES OF SWISS FOUNDATIONS</h2>
    <p>
      Private foundations and family foundations:
      This type of foundation must have a “noble goal” for the protection of nature or fighting illness, for example. Family foundations, meaning that the beneficiaries are family members or people close to the founders, is lawful if the assets of the foundation are designated for the education, establishment, or assistance of family members.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pension fund for staff
      Switzerland's mandatory pension funds can be channeled through a foundation to which employer and employee contributions are paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Public benefit foundation
      If a foundation is recognized for the benefit of people, it enjoys certain tax benefits.
      It should be noted that some foundations which own large commercial enterprises obtain the tax status of a holding company. 
    </p>
    <h2>Administration of a Swiss foundation</h2>
    <p>
      The board of trustees is the governing body of the foundation. Its objectives are the objectives of the founders which are described in the foundation mission statement.
    </p>
    <h2>State controls</h2>
    <p>
      Family foundations are not subject to monitoring controls by local authorities. Other foundations are subject to controls by the local authorities which depend on the achievement of the foundation's goals. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Board of Trustees of the foundation is required to submit a report of Our activities along with a financial annual report approved by auditors.
    </p>
    <h2>Swiss law: Foundation charter</h2>
    <p>
      The foundation charter is a deed poll by the founder(s) and contains:
      The name of the founders
      Attributed funds or property
      The goal of the foundations
      A designated board of the foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a legal entity, a Swiss foundation must conform to a relatively strict definition.
      Once the purpose has been set out in the charter, it cannot be changed without the approval of the supervisory authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to acquire legal personality, the foundation must be listed on the Swiss Commercial Registry.
    </p>
    <h2>Entry in the commercial register</h2>
    <p>
      To complete the setup of a foundation, it must be entered in the commercial register (exception: the family foundation and the church foundation may enter the register voluntarily). This entry is made as part of the deed of foundation and contains the members of the foundation’s council, as well as the auditors.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, foundations are tax exempt in Switzerland. However, a condition of this is that we have recognized charitable status.

    <h2>Requirements to set up a Swiss Foundation</h2>
    <p>
      A foundation has the following mandatory organs:
      The Foundation Council
      An Audit Board
      As a general rule, the Swiss foundation must have a minimum share capital of CHF 50,000;
    </p>
    <p>
      Other requirements include:
      Registered agent and office
      Minimum number of founders is two
      Requirement to prepare and file accounts
      The accounts must be accessible to the public
    </p>
    <h2>Switzerland Foundation Tax Treatment</h2>
    <p>Between 0% and 24%</p>
    <h2>Switzerland Foundation Duration for Set Up</h2>
    <p>Around 4 Weeks</p>
    <h2>Benefits of a Swiss Foundation</h2>
    <p>
      Since it is registered with the goal of improving the general condition of the society, this structure benefits from certain tax exemptions.
      The foundation can also qualify for a low tax system – for example, the corporate tax is applied at a rate of 4% in the case of family foundations. 
      There is a full exemption on the payment of the corporate tax of a foundation, but this is applicable only if the structure is registered as an entity for the public benefit or as a non-profit foundation

      Foreign investors can open a company in the Czech Republic, but we can also set up an investment fund. The legislation applicable to investment funds in Czech Republic is different than the one applicable to commercial companies. Investment vehicles in Czech Republic are regulated under the Act on Investment Companies and Investment Funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the AIFMD and UCITS directives, the Investment Management and Investment Funds Regulation covers rules for products (funds) and providers (fund managers, administrators, depositaries) and other rules (cross-border services, marketing).
    </p>
    <p>
      The new Act on Investment Companies and Investment Funds provides new investment opportunities to both local and foreign investors. The Act establishes new investment vehicles, as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>SICAV (investment company with variable capital);</li>
      <li>trust funds.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The Act was modified in order to align with the regulations available under the Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIMF). Investors who are interested in company formation in Czech Republic must know that the new Act is available for the investment funds operating on this market, as well as for other types of investment entities which manage the assets of such funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the new Act, which implements the AIMF regulations, alternative investment fund managers are required to register with the Czech National Bank (CNB). Moreover, all persons who are interested in investing capital in Czech Republic must notify CNB on this matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2013, the Czech government enacted new laws regulating the investment funds, in order to align with the directives prescribed by the EU. At the level of 2013, three new forms of investment funds became available in Czech Republic, as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>the joint stock company with variable capital (SICAV),</li>
      <li>the limited partnership, and</li>
      <li>the trust fund.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In addition, investors can also register the following structures: mutual funds, joint stock companies, limited liability companies, and European companies. Businessmen who are interested in company formation in Czech Republic should also know that the fund legislation available here provides another type of vehicle – the Qualified Investor Fund (QIF).

    <h1>Estonia Investment and Pension Funds</h1>
    <p>
      Investment and pension funds are pools of assets or companies that are established to make collective investments, and which are managed, or whose assets are managed, by management companies using the principle of risk distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Investment funds are divided into public and non-public investment funds depending on what we offer. Public funds are primarily aimed at public provision to ordinary investors, while non-public funds cater to professional investors.
    </p>
    <p>
      A license is needed to manage public investment and pension funds, and this is issued by, and can be withdrawn by, Finantsinspektsioon. To manage a non-public fund, the fund manager should apply for an operating license or register its activities with Finantsinspektsioon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following types of investment fund may be established in Estonia:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>euro funds (UCITS)</li>
      <li>alternative investment funds (AIF)</li>
      <li>statutory pension funds</li>
      <li>voluntary pension funds</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Investment funds are generally established as contractual funds, but it is possible in certain cases to operate as a company (a private limited company, a public limited company, or a limited partnership).
    </p>
    <p>
      Approving the conditions or statutes of an investment fund:
    </p>
    <p>
      The conditions and statutes of public investment funds, including pension funds, and any changes to them need to be approved by Finantsinspektsioon. Where relevant, changes to the prospectus of a public investment fund also need to be approved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procedures for approving the conditions, statutes, and prospectus and changes to them are set out in the Investment Funds Act. The fees for the approval procedures and adjustments to them are set out in the Financial Supervision Authority Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conditions and statutes of non-public investment funds are generally approved by the management board of the fund manager. Changes to the conditions of the statutes of the fund are decided by a general meeting of the fund if its documentation does not require otherwise. The conditions and statutes of non-public investment funds are not approved by Finantsinspektsioon, making it important for investors to look carefully at the relevance and correctness of the documentation of the fund being offered to them.

      EIFs are funds designed for professional, high net worth or experienced investors and are in accordance with the regime established under Part 18 of The Financial Services Act (the Act). A CIS is any arrangement regarding a property of any description, the purpose or effect of which is to enable persons taking part in the arrangement (whether by becoming owners of the property or any part of it or otherwise) to participate in or receive profits or income arising from the acquisition, holding, management, or disposal of the property or sums paid out of such profits or income.
    </p>
    <h2>The Board</h2>
    <p>
      Funds are able to set up as Protected Cell Companies if the GFSC is satisfied that there is a reduction in associated risks. The GFSC will take into consideration whether the board of directors as a whole has the appropriate skills, experience, and understanding. The Board must be able to demonstrate that there is adequate oversight over the different cells and the directors have time and resources to deal with the additional cells.
    </p>
    <h2>Depositary</h2>
    <p>
      An EIF is required to appoint a depositary unless the fund is a closed-end fund or the GFSC makes a determination to that effect.
    </p>
    <h2>Administrator</h2>
    <p>
      The administrator of an EIF must be domiciled and regulated in Gibraltar or, if not so authorized, be established in a jurisdiction where it is regulated in accordance with a legislative and regulatory regime that provides at least equivalent protection to the regime in Gibraltar.
    </p>
    <h2>Authorization of EIF</h2>
    <p>
      The administrator of an EIF will either:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notify the GFSC of the establishment of the fund within 10 (working) days of an EIF being established; or</li>
      <li>Notify the GFSC at least 10 (working) days before the fund is established to enable the fund to be registered with the GFSC prior to being launched.</li>

There are comprehensive rules which regulate the documents by which a Class A scheme is established, the content of the relevant scheme particulars, the general administration of the scheme and the investment parameters; or</li>
      <li>Class Q: restricted to qualifying professional investors. The rules governing such schemes are less prescriptive than those for Class A and Class B schemes and a fast-track approval process should be available.</li>

    </p>
    <p>
      Each Guernsey domiciled authorised fund must have a designated manager (who conducts the day-to-day administration of the fund). The designated manager shall be licensed under the POI Law and operate, and have a place of business in Guernsey. In the case of authorised closed-ended investment funds, the GFSC is willing to consider the appointment of a custodian/trustee domiciled outside of Guernsey although there is no requirement to appoint a Custodian.

      Unless the closed-ended investment Fund can be classed as a Qualifying Investor or registered Fund, both of which are subject to a turnaround time of three working days, there is a three-stage process which applies to closed-ended investment Funds:

    <p>
      For an Incorporated Cell Company (ICC) or Protected Cell Company (PCC), a separate formal consent/approval needs to be issued following outline authorisation in order that the vehicle can be registered with the Guernsey Registry.

      There are three classes of authorised open-ended funds:

      <li>
        <strong>Class A Funds:</strong> These funds are authorised under The Authorised Collective Investment Schemes (Class A) Rules 2008 (the “Class A Fund” or the “Class A Rules”). Class A Funds must comply with the Class A Rules, which enable them to be recognised under the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, allowing them to be promoted to the public in the UK similarly to UK-authorised unit trusts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Class B Funds:</strong> These funds are usually marketed to institutional or professional investors, but not exclusively. The Class B Rules lay down requirements for the information contained in the principal documents. We offer flexibility while reflecting best practices. The main requirement is that the assets of a Class B Fund must be invested with the aim of spreading risk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Class Q Funds:</strong> These funds may only be marketed to qualifying professional investors and are subject to relatively simpler rules. The Class Q Rules prescribe requirements for the information available to prospective investors in a scheme’s principal documents. Similar to Class B Funds, the property of a Class Q Fund must be invested to provide a spread of risk in accordance with disclosed limits or restrictions.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      There are restrictions on the types of investors who can invest in Class Q Funds (qualified professional investors only) and in Class B Funds and Class Q Funds that elect to be classified as Qualifying Investor Funds (QIFs) (qualified investors).

    <h1>Guernsey Green Funds</h1>
    <p>
      Any investment fund established and regulated in Guernsey can seek designation as a Guernsey Green Fund. To do so, a fund must ensure its principal documents comply with the Guernsey Green Fund Rules and ensure its portfolio meets the 'green criteria' set out in the Guernsey Green Fund Rules. Having done so and obtained certification, the fund will then be entitled to use the Guernsey Green Fund brand and logo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objective of the Guernsey Green Fund is to provide a platform upon which investments into various green initiatives can be made. The Guernsey Green Fund enhances investor access to the green investment space by providing a trusted and transparent product that contributes to the internationally agreed objectives of mitigating environmental damage and climate change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the Guernsey Green Fund Rules, Green Funds must invest 75% of Our portfolio in investments meeting the green criteria. At present, the green criteria used are the Common Principles for Climate Mitigation Finance Tracking developed by the joint finance group of multilateral development banks which permit investments in:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Renewable energy projects</li>
      <li>Energy efficiency initiatives</li>
      <li>Sustainable land use</li>
      <li>Clean transportation</li>
      <li>Climate change adaptation projects</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The Green Fund's remaining 25% of the portfolio can be invested in other asset classes, provided investments do not lessen or reduce the Green Fund’s overall objective of mitigating environmental damage (with certain investments being expressly excluded as a result). The application of ESG Principles to investment analysis and decision-making is voluntary.
    </p>
    <h2>The Green Certification Process</h2>
    <p>
      The Green Fund Rules allow Green Funds to be established using one of two routes, dependent on who certifies the Green Fund's underlying investments' compliance with the Green Criteria.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Route 1:</strong> Funds require certification from an independent third party with adequate expertise to provide a reliable and accurate assessment of the Green Fund’s ability to meet the Green investment criteria.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Route 2:</strong> Allows certification by the Guernsey licensed administrator or manager for the Fund.

    <h1>Ireland Alternative Investment Fund (Non UCITS Fund)</h1>
    <p>
      An alternative investment fund (AIF) is a type of collective investing where funds are raised from a number of investors with a view to investing them in accordance with a defined investment policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      AIFs are authorized in one of two categories:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A Retail Investor AIF (“RIAIF”) is an AIF authorized by the Central Bank which may be marketed to retail investors.</li>
      <li>A Qualifying Investor AIF (“QIAIF”) is an AIF authorized by the Central Bank which may be marketed to Qualifying Investors.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      A RIAIF may be marketed to retail investors and no minimum subscription requirements apply. A RIAIF must utilize an authorized Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”). However, as it is a retail product, a RIAIF cannot avail of the automatic right to market across Europe under the AIFMD marketing passport. The marketing passport provides access only to professional investors. The Central Bank of Ireland imposes investment restrictions (e.g., limitations on investments in securities which are not traded on a regulated market) and diversification requirements on RIAIFs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most AIFs are established as AIFMD compliant QIAIFs. A QIAIF offers an investment manager a structure with virtually no investment restrictions. Only “qualifying investors,” i.e., an informed investor or professional client under MiFID, may invest, and a minimum investment of €100,000 is required. There are no limits on subsequent investments.
    </p>
    <h2>Benefits of launching a QIAIF in Ireland</h2>
    <p>
      A QIAIF offers flexibility which is not available within UCITS or RIAIFs such as:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The requirements for twice monthly liquidity, diversification of investments, and borrowing restrictions that apply to a UCITS fund do not apply to a QIAIF.</li>
      <li>A QIAIF may invest in a full range of assets from listed securities to exotic derivatives, hedge funds, ETFs, private equity, real estate, precious metals, and infrastructure assets.</li>
      <li>Distribution channels: A QIAIF authorized under AIFMD can avail of an EU marketing passport for sale to professional investors within the EU.</li>
      <li>Leading funds domicile</li>
      <li>Expertise in alternative and complex strategies</li>
      <li>Efficient regulatory approval process</li>
      <li>Favorable taxation regime</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Taxation</h2>
    <p>
      QIAIFs are not subject to Irish taxation on either income or gains.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>No Irish tax applies to the net assets of a QIAIF.</li>
      <li>Distributions may be made to non-Irish shareholders without the application of withholding taxes.</li>
      <li>Wide-ranging VAT exemptions are available on services to a QIAIF (administration expenses, depositary expenses, and investment management expenses).</li>
      <li>QIAIFs may access Ireland’s double taxation treaty network with over 70 countries.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1> Ireland Undertaking for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS )</h1>
    <p>

      <li>to seek a single authorization in one EU member state, and</li>
      <li>to register for sale and market across EU member states.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      UCITS established in Ireland are authorized under the European Communities (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) Regulations 2011 (“the UCITS Regulations”). The UCITS Regulations, which transpose Council Directive 2009/65/EC, Commission Directive 2010/43/EC, and Commission Directive 2010/44/EC into Irish law, are effective from 1 July 2011.

    <h1>Malta Collective Investment Schemes</h1>
    <p>
      Collective Investment Schemes are financial products where money from several different investors is pooled and then invested by a fund manager according to specific criteria. The scheme or fund is divided into segments called ‘units’, which are to some degree similar to shares. Investors take a stake in the fund by buying these units, we will therefore become unitholders. The price of a unit is based on the value of the investments the fund has invested in. Collective investment schemes may have different fee structures, make sure you understand how you will be charged before you invest as charges may have a major impact on the performance of your investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A collective investment scheme (CIS) is defined by the Malta Investment Services Act as a scheme or arrangement which has as its object the collective investment of capital acquired by means of an offer of units for subscription, sale or exchange and which has any of the following characteristics:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The scheme or arrangement operates according to the principle of risk spreading, and either:
        <ol>
          <li>The contributions of the participants and the profits or income out of which payments are to be made to them are pooled; or</li>
          <li>At the request of the holders, units are or are to be re-purchased or redeemed out of the assets of the scheme, or arrangement, continuously or in blocks at short intervals; or</li>
          <li>Units are, or have been, or will be issued continuously or in blocks at short intervals.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      A CIS may be set up in Malta as a:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>SICAV (investment company with variable share capital (i.e. an open-ended fund)</li>
      <li>Investment company with fixed share capital (i.e. a closed-ended fund)</li>
      <li>Contractual Fund</li>
      <li>Limited Partnership</li>
      <li>Incorporated Cell Company; or</li>
      <li>Unit Trust.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      CISs can be licensed as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>UCITS Schemes: UCITS Schemes are open-ended schemes licensed in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Services Act. Within this framework, these Schemes benefit from passporting rights within the EU and can hence be marketed in other EU or EEA Member States.</li>
      <li>Alternative Investment Funds: This category of funds includes non-UCITS Retail Schemes and Professional Investor Funds (PIFs). Non-UCITS Retail Schemes can be open-ended or closed-ended retail schemes. On the other hand, PIFs are regulated under a separate framework which is particularly suited for funds sold internationally on a private placement basis.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Collective Investment schemes in Malta are monitored by the Malta Financial Services Authority which, besides having the responsibility for the licensing process, is also responsible for the regulation and ongoing supervision of Collective Investment Schemes. It is to be noted however that the following Malta CIS are exempted from the requirement to operate according to the principle of risk spreading:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Alternative investment funds marketed to professional investors;</li>
      <li>A collective investment scheme licensed as a professional investor fund targeting qualifying investors in terms of the Investment Services Rules;</li>
      <li>A collective investment scheme licensed as a professional investor fund targeting extraordinary investors in terms of the Investment Services Rules.</li>

      The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) announced on 11 February 2016 a new fund structure for Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs): the Notified AIF. This new framework is aimed at qualifying investors and professional investors under MiFID.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new regime will only be applicable to AIFs, whether open-ended or closed-ended, which are not already licensed by the MFSA. The regime is not available for:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Loan funds;</li>
      <li>AIFs which are not marketed and sold exclusively to professional and/or qualifying investors; or</li>
      <li>Funds which invest in non-financial assets (e.g. real estate).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      An AIF, in relation to which a notification may be submitted, may be in the form of one of the below structures:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>An Investment Company with Variable Share Capital (SICAV),</li>
      <li>An Investment Company with Fixed Share Capital (INVCO),</li>
      <li>An Incorporated Cell Company of a SICAV ICC,</li>
      <li>An Incorporated Cell of a Recognized Incorporated Cell Company (RICC),</li>
      <li>A Contractual Fund.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Main Features of the Notified Alternative Investment Fund (NAIF)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The Investment Fund is not subject to the licensing process by the MFSA;</li>
      <li>The NAIF is subject to a Notification Process;</li>
      <li>Onus of Due-Diligence & Ongoing supervision lie within the AIFM;</li>
      <li>The NAIF can be both open & closed ended;</li>
      <li>The NAIF cannot be self-managed;</li>
      <li>The NAIF cannot be in the form of a Loan Fund;</li>
      <li>The NAIF cannot invest in non-financial assets, including real-estate;</li>
      <li>The AIFM is to appoint an MLRO as oversight over the NAIF.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Although the NAIF is not subject to the 3-phased licensing procedure, it is still subject to a Notification process. Such process is structured as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A written request by the AIFM in respect of an AIF – and its sub-funds, if any – to be included in the list of Notified AIFs in the form and manner as required by the MFSA;</li>
      <li>Prior submission of (1) above, the governing body of the AIF shall approve a resolution certifying that the Prospectus of the AIF satisfies the minimum criteria as prescribed by the MFSA;</li>
      <li>The AIFM shall submit the duly completed written notification together with the accompanying documents within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the resolution of the governing body of the AIF whereby approving the AIF's prospectus and prior to the effective date of the prospectus;</li>
      <li>The competent authority should include the AIF in the List of Notified AIFs within ten (10) working days from the date of filing of the notification request together with the completed required documentation.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Benefits of NAIF</h2>
    <p>
      Benefits include a quick process, which means fund managers can bring AIFs to market more swiftly. There is also no regulation of the AIF by the MFSA – as the name suggests, this framework only requires a notification. One important distinction to draw between the Notified AIF and the new QIAIF and RAIF structures in Ireland and Luxembourg, respectively, is that there is no requirement for domestic service providers to be appointed by the fund.

    <h1>Collective Investment Schemes in Netherlands</h1>
    <p>
      Collective Investment Schemes are more frequently known as ‘investment funds’, ‘mutual funds’ or simply ‘funds’. We invest in assets, such as bonds, equities, or cash. The collective assets owned by the fund are called a portfolio, and we are managed by a professional fund manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under section 2:65 of the Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht / Wft) companies that manage collective investment schemes are required to have a license. The Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financiële Markten) is the body that issues licenses to companies to act as management companies of collective investment schemes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, a manager requires a registration in certain situations in order to manage an AIFM and/or to offer units or shares in the Netherlands to investors.
    </p>
    <h2>Features and requirements for AIFM in Netherlands</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The process involves submission of a template application form plus numerous supporting documents to the Netherlands Authority for Financial Markets (“AFM”) for review. Part of the application is a test of suitability and reliability of the board members and supervisory board members of the AIFM</li>
      <li>Additional forms must be provided along with the application form: – Notification form AIFs, Notification form AIFM depositary and Application form for suitability and reliability testing for each (supervisory) board member</li>
      <li>The AFM can decide within 13 weeks, however, the AFM may use up to 26 weeks in which case the AFM will inform the applicant thereof. As such, the practical timetable is around 8 months (including preparation time)</li>
      <li>The AFM charges an application fee of €5,500, and additional fees for the suitability and reliability tests.</li>
      <li>Initial capital of €125,000 required, unless an AIF is set up as an investment entity with legal personality without a separate AIFM in which case initial capital of €300,000 is required. Additional own funds required if the AIFM does not have a separate professional indemnity insurance</li>
      <li>In addition to AIFMD depositary, a ‘legal owner’ must be appointed if AIFM sets up AIFs without legal personality to hold the assets</li>
      <li>Four eyes principle is applied. AIFM should have at least two day-to-day policymakers</li>
      <li>AIFM with an official seat in the Netherlands, head office must be in the Netherlands</li>
      <li>The standard corporate income tax rate on income is 20% (for profits up to €200,000) / 25% (for profits in excess of €200,000)</li>
      <li>No withholding tax on interest and royalty payments. Standard Dutch dividend withholding tax rate on outgoing dividends is 15%, however, a reduction or exemption may be applicable on the basis of EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive, a double tax treaty or by the use of a Dutch “cooperative”. So tax-free repatriation to US, UK and a wide range of other jurisdictions is generally available</li>
      <li>Income from employment is subject to income tax at progressive rates up to 52%. However, certain qualifying foreign employees that move to the Netherlands may be able to apply for a “30% ruling”, which may result in an effective maximum income tax rate of 36.4% (instead of 52%)</li>
      <li>An AIFM must have legal personality under Dutch corporate law (typically a Dutch private limited company is incorporated). Incorporation requires the assistance of a Dutch civil law notary</li>
      <li>The entity will need to be registered with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Benefits of AIFM in Netherlands</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Broad domestic and treaty dividend withholding tax exemptions</li>
      <li>Limited quantitative requirements on corporate governance</li>
      <li>Data protection legislation is very similar to the UK in terms of practical application</li>
    </ol>

  <div>
    <h1>Non-Guernsey Schemes (NGS)</h1>
    <p>
      A Non-Guernsey Scheme (NGS) is a collective investment scheme that is not established or incorporated in the Bailiwick of Guernsey (the Bailiwick) and is not authorised or registered by the Commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the current regime, an entity licensed under the Protection of Investors (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 1987 (a POI licensee) that intends to manage, administer, or provide custody to an NGS is required to give prior written notice to and seek formal approval from the Commission before commencing any of those restricted activities in respect of each NGS (note that a POI licensee may act for an NGS which is authorised in Jersey, Isle of Man, United Kingdom and Ireland without prior approval). Once approved, the POI licensee is subject to the NGS Rules, which are currently only applied in practice to restricted activities carried out in connection with open-ended collective investment schemes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the proposals, the requirement for prior notification and approval will be removed and replaced with a requirement that the POI licensee submits additional information in its annual return on the activities it has undertaken in respect of all investment assets serviced in Guernsey. The fees associated with NGS, i.e. notification and annual fees, will naturally fall away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GFSC must give specific approval to a local licensee before that licensee may commence providing services in relation to a non-Guernsey open-ended scheme. In considering whether or not to approve such a proposal, the GFSC will take into account:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The protection and enhancement of the reputation of the Bailiwick as a financial center;</li>
      <li>The general nature and specific attributes of the controlled investment business to which the proposal relates; and</li>
      <li>Any other factors that the GFSC considers appropriate to consider. Normally, approval will only be given if the non-Guernsey open-ended fund would have been likely to obtain authorization under the Protection of Investors (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 1987, as amended.</li>

    <h1>Czech Republic Joint Stock Company</h1>
    <p>
      A Czech joint stock company (in Czech: “akciová společnost”) is defined by Act No. 90/2012 Coll., on commercial companies and cooperatives, as amended (hereinafter the “Act on Commercial Corporations”) as a company registered capital of which is divided into a certain number of shares of certain nominal value. The Czech joint stock company is liable for breaches of its obligations by its entire property. Its shareholders are not liable for breaches of the company´s obligations at all. The Czech joint stock company is a widely used type of business entity in the Czech Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Czech joint-stock company is the second most common form of business corporations in the Czech Republic. Thanks to stricter regulations over management, the joint stock company is a good business vehicle for shareholders willing to register a business but not be involved in its day-to-day management. It’s an adequate vehicle for both trading and manufacturing activities.
    </p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The minimum amount of the registered capital of the joint-stock company is CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 73,000).</li>
      <li>A joint-stock company is established at least by one founder on the basis of Articles of Association which are executed in the form of the notarial deed of a Czech notary and signed by all the founders.</li>
      <li>A Czech joint stock company has three statutory bodies: General Meeting, Board of Directors, and Supervisory Board.</li>
      <li>Liability is limited to the ownership of shares. The className, number, and nominal value of shares along with the list of board of directors and supervisory board members with Our dates of birth and residence addresses must be registered at the Commercial Registry.</li>
      <li>The supervisory board and the board of directors must each have at least three members, none of which can serve on both of them. If a company has only a sole shareholder, the board of directors need not have three members (i.e. one director is sufficient in such cases), however, the supervisory board must always have three members, even if the company has a sole shareholder.</li>
      <li>Annual accounts must be audited by a registered auditor and published on condition that at least one of the following three conditions in the prior or current accounting period is met: (1) turnover exceeds CZK 80 mil., (2) assets exceed CZK 40 mil., and (3) the number of employees exceeds 50.</li>
      <li>It is also known as AS.</li>
      <li>Corporate tax is 19%.</li>
      <li>No resident manager required.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Advantages of joint stock company</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Shares can be, under certain conditions, publicly traded on the stock exchange.</li>
      <li>More flexible transfer of ownership through the transfer of shares, although this depends on the type of shares.</li>
      <li>Exists independently of its shareholders, who are not liable for the debts and obligations of the company.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Obtaining a Czech business license</h2>
    <p>
      After the founding deed is executed, the members of the company’s statutory body need to obtain the trade license at the Trade License Office unless the company’s business activity includes only management of own property, letting of real estate, residential units and non-residential units, or a special permit is required. The administration fee for obtaining the trade license at the Trade License Office amounts to CZK 1,000 (EUR 40).

    <h1>Czech Republic Limited Liability Company (LLC)</h1>
    <p>
      A Czech limited liability company (in Czech: “společnost s ručením omezeným”) is the simplest and the most common type of business entity in the Czech Republic. By definition of Act No. 90/2012 Coll., on commercial companies and cooperatives, as amended (hereinafter the “Act on Commercial Corporations”), it is a Czech corporation whose registered capital is made up of its members' investment contributions and whose members are liable (as sureties) for the company's obligations only until Our contributions are paid up and registered in the Commercial Register. The Czech limited liability company is liable for breaches of its obligations with its entire property, which can be higher and is not necessarily equal to the registered capital. Its members are jointly and severally liable for the company's obligations only up to the unpaid investment contributions of all members according to the entry in the Commercial Register.
    </p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The company may also be founded by a sole founder, a legal entity, or a natural person, while the maximum number of members is 50, no shares are issued; each member holds an “ownership interest”.</li>
      <li>A Limited Liability Company with a sole member cannot be a sole member of another Limited Liability Company. A natural person can be a sole member of a maximum of three Limited Liability Companies.</li>
      <li>Limited Liability Company has two statutory bodies, General Meeting and Executives, and one voluntary organ, Supervisory Board.</li>
      <li>Also known as SRO.</li>
      <li>Standard corporate tax 19%.</li>
      <li>Annual tax returns should be submitted.</li>
      <li>Minimum issued share capital is 1 euro.</li>
      <li>No resident manager/director required.</li>
      <li>Minimum number of shareholders is 1.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The main advantages of a limited liability company are:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Fewer regulations than a joint-stock company.</li>
      <li>Less registered capital and reserve fund required than for a joint-stock company.</li>
      <li>It can have one sole owner being either an individual or a legal entity.</li>
      <li>It requires only a Memorandum of Association (not Articles of Association), unless the Memorandum stipulates otherwise.</li>
      <li>It does not require a Supervisory Board (unless the Memorandum of Association stipulates otherwise – in practice Czech limited liability companies with supervisory board are very rare).</li>

    <h1>Estonia Public Limited Company</h1>
    <p>
      Estonia’s economy has boomed in recent years as it has pursued a liberal business agenda in preparation for EU membership, which was finally achieved in 2004. Foreign investment has flooded into this small Baltic state enabling it to create a relatively relaxed environment for the international business community. However, Estonia is still developing and investors considering establishing a company in the country should tread carefully. It is particularly important here to seek professional advice on all legal, financial, and tax matters. We have a network of carefully-selected local advisers, so please contact us for assistance regarding company registration in Estonia.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Features and Legal Requirements</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Should have a registered office in Estonia.</li>
      <li>Time to establish the company is 1-2 Days.</li>
      <li>Corporate tax is 24%.</li>

      <li>Minimum number of directors is one.</li>
      <li>No residency requirements for the directors.</li>
      <li>Minimum number of shareholders is one.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Benefits of PLC in Estonia</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Political stability: Estonia is a democratic and peaceful state, and the country’s stability and international credibility are further underpinned by its membership of the EU, the WTO, and NATO.</li>
      <li>Economic stability: Although economic growth has slowed of late, the Estonian Government welcomes foreign investment with open arms, a policy reflected in the country’s favorable flat tax system. Sound macroeconomic management has led to a strong banking system, and while the euro has brought costs, such as labor costs, more into line with the rest of the EU, we remain broadly lower than in Western Europe.</li>
      <li>Location: Estonia is situated at the crossroads of Eastern Europe, Russia, and Scandinavia and is well connected to these territories by sea, road, and air.</li>
      <li>Tax: Corporate and personal income taxes are comparatively low and simple thanks to the introduction of a flat tax, while corporations pay no tax on undistributed and reinvested profits. Withholding taxes are also favorable, and Estonia has a large network of double tax avoidance treaties. Estonia is therefore an ideal hub for export, trading, and holding company activities.</li>
      <li>Technology: Estonia has invested fairly heavily in telecommunications infrastructure.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>
      Limited partners, like shareholders in a corporation, have limited liability, which means that we are only liable on debts incurred by the firm to the extent of Our registered investment and as such have no management authority.
    </p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>A person may be both a general partner and a limited partner, as can a body corporate or partnership.</li>

      <li>
        Every limited partnership shall have, in writing, a partnership agreement setting out the affairs of the partnership and the conduct of its business. The agreement shall be binding upon the partners and Our assigns and upon subsequent partners. The agreement can only be amended by an instrument in writing.

    <h1>Irish Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)</h1>
    <p>
      An Irish Limited Partnership is a business structure in which some members have limited liability for the debts of the firm. Our liability is limited to the extent of Our contribution. As with a general partnership, a limited partnership is not a separate legal entity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Limited Partnerships in Ireland should consist of no more than 20 persons. If it is a banking partnership, the maximum limit is 10 persons unless it is an investment and loan finance partnership, in which case there is a limit of 50 persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The partnership must consist of at least one general partner and one limited partner. The general partner is liable for all the debts and obligations of the firm. The limited partner contributes a stated amount of capital and is not liable for debts that are beyond that amount. The limited partner must be excluded from the management of the firm and cannot have any authority to bind the other partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event of the closure of a Limited Partnership, the general partners are required to wind up its affairs unless the court otherwise orders. It is best practice to notify the Registrar of Companies of the dissolution.
    </p>
    <h2>Features of LLP</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>An LP must have at least one general partner and one limited partner.</li>
      <li>The partnership must contain more than 2 persons or, if carrying a financial business, 50 members are required.</li>
      <li>The general partners of the company are liable for the debt and obligations of the firm.</li>
      <li>Whereas the limited partners contribute a stated amount of capital and are not liable for the debt and obligations of the company beyond the amount contributed.</li>
      <li>The LLPs must submit accounts and annual returns to the Registrar of Companies each year.</li>
      <li>An LLP is not a separate legal entity.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Steps to register limited partnership in Ireland</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The first step is to register your partnership name at the Companies Registration Office (CRO). The name must not be similar to that of any existing company in Ireland.</li>
      <li>An application Form LP1 must be filled and submitted to the CRO. This form must be signed by both the general and limited partners.</li>
      <li>Next, another Form LP3 must be filled which includes a statement of the capital contributed by the partners. The form can be signed by any of the general partners.</li>
      <li>A deed must be signed by all the partners. It must include the following content:
        <ol>
          <li>Partnership name</li>
          <li>Nature of the business and management to be conducted for and on behalf of the LP by the general partner</li>
          <li>Change of partners - resignation, expulsion, transfer of interests or new additions</li>
          <li>Distribution/application of profits - discharging creditors should always be first</li>
          <li>Limits of Authority on the general partner’s powers</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The final step is to pay the registration fees after which your registration process is completed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Advantages of LLP</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Limits Potential Legal Liability. A main benefit of creating an LLP is a balance of management control with reduced liability exposure.</li>
      <li>Allows for Flexible Roles for Partners.</li>
      <li>Provides for Relative Ease of Formation.</li>
      <li>Offers Possible Pass-Through Tax Relief.</li>

    <h1>Netherlands Holding Company</h1>
    <p>
      A holding company in the Netherlands is simply a legal entity that is used not for the purpose of engaging in the provision and supply of goods and services, but it is incorporated for the purpose of holding shares in other companies. The main purpose for the owner is to be able to collect dividends through the holding company. This is a vehicle that is flexible, due to the local Dutch legislation, and offers advantages when used by a single investor and even when used by multiple partners (much as a partnership would) even if the said partners engage in different activities (the holding company then becomes a shared tax vehicle).
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding companies in the Netherlands are regulated by the Dutch Company Act and can be registered as:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Limited liability companies</li>
      <li>Partnerships</li>
      <li>Foundations</li>
      <li>Cooperatives</li>

      <li>Best use of the company is tax planning.</li>
      <li>Requires a registered office in the Netherlands.</li>

      <li>A company secretary is required.</li>
      <li>Duration to set up is 3 weeks.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Taxation Principles for Holding Companies in the Netherlands</h2>
    <p>
      The following features define the taxation of a Dutch holding company:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The participation exemption: a holding company can be tax exempt on qualifying holdings (detailed below).</li>
      <li>Tax reduction: when the participation exemption applies, the expenses related to subsidiaries can generally be deductible.</li>
      <li>No substance requirements: a Dutch holding company does not impose substance requirements and the company does not need to have employees.</li>
      <li>No withholding tax rate on dividends: the dividend payments made to a Dutch holding company by an EU subsidiary are under the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive.</li>
      <li>No currency exchange restrictions: this company is not subject to restrictions for receiving income in the Netherlands or repatriating funds from the Netherlands; some reporting requirements do apply, and one of our taxation lawyers in the Netherlands can give you more details.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Corporate tax for a Netherlands Holding Company is 25%.</p>
    <h2>Benefits of a Dutch Holding Company</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>A Netherlands Holding company is a separate legal entity.</li>
      <li>Opening a corporate bank account in the Netherlands is inexpensive.</li>

    <h1>Switzerland Joint Stock Company</h1>
    <p>
      Joint stock companies are business vehicles in which shareholders buy and incorporate different stocks. In Switzerland, the joint stock company (Aktiengesellschaft, AG) is a very common type of business entity and is mostly employed by foreign investors wanting to start a medium-sized or a large corporation. The greatest advantage of the joint stock company is that its Swiss shareholders will have limited liability with respect to the company’s assets. The Swiss joint stock company can undertake different business activities, including manufacturing, trading, and financial services. It can also be employed as a Swiss holding company or as a subsidiary of a foreign entity.

    <h1>Switzerland Limited Liability Company (SARL) / (LLC)</h1>
    <p>
      A Switzerland Limited Liability Company (SARL) / (LLC) is a company whose liability is limited to the contributions of its members. This is why its name is a “Société à Responsabilité Limitée” (SARL), which is translated into “Society with Limited Responsibility”. It is a private limited liability corporation also designated by the abbreviation “GmbH” (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), which is German for “company with limited liability”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SARL is similar to a limited liability company or LLC in the United States, and a United Kingdom private company limited by shares.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Civil Code of Switzerland administers all business entities. While Switzerland is a federal republic, it does not maintain a centralized federal registration system for its business entities. Each of the 26 cantons (similar to provinces or states) registers every business in its jurisdiction with its own Commercial Registry.
    </p>
    <h2>Features of an LLC in Switzerland</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Minimum capital required to form an LLC is CHF 20,000.</li>
      <li>Minimum one shareholder is mandatory.</li>
      <li>At least one executive director has to have Our domicile in Switzerland.</li>
      <li>Foreigners can own 100% of the shares.</li>
      <li>In general, there is a free choice of the company name. The term “GmbH” has to be added to the company name.</li>
      <li>Shareholders’ liabilities are limited to Our share contributions.</li>
      <li>Minimum number of directors is one.</li>
      <li>A Board of Directors is not required.</li>
      <li>Every SARL must maintain an office in Switzerland and appoint a local registered agent to accept service of process and official notices.</li>
      <li>Annual general meetings are required for the shareholders.</li>
      <li>The average timeframe to form a new SARL can take between 3 to 5 working days.</li>
      <li>Corporate tax rates vary according to the province of registration of the business, ranging between 12.5% and 24%.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to Set Up an LLC in Switzerland?</h2>
    <p>
      One or more natural persons or a legal entity is required in order to register an LLC in Switzerland. The management structure of the LLC or the GmbH in Switzerland is also quite simple and does not require high costs. No board of directors is mandatory for a Swiss GmbH, but the main decision maker is the managing director who has full responsibility for the company.
    </p>
    <p>The steps to LLC company formation in Switzerland are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create an Escrow Account to Hold Paid-Up Capital: This step essentially tells to set up a bank account for the company. The government of Switzerland needs to confirm that you have enough money to start a company before granting the registration. The capital requirement for an LLC in Switzerland is CHF 20,000.</li>
      <li>Draft Registration Paperwork in front of the Notary: The next step after opening a bank account in Switzerland is to submit the application for registration, which then has to be certified by the Public Notary. The application includes Articles of Association, signatures of the managing board, Stamp Declaration Form, Lex Friedrich Declaration Form, and public deed of incorporation.</li>
      <li>File the Completed Application Form with the Local Commercial Register: The notarized documents must be mailed to the Office of the Commercial Register, alongside a fee for incorporation. The size of this fee will vary based on how much capital your company has. It takes around 15 days for the government to review and approve your application.</li>
      <li>Register for VAT: Once your application has been approved by the commercial registry you’ll need to register for the Value Added Tax for taxation purposes. All Swiss companies are required to file annual financial statements.</li>
      <li>Enroll your Company Employees in the National Social Insurance Program: After completing registration, the Cantonal Social Security office (Ausgleichskasse) will send the paperwork for registering employees in the national social insurance system. This system includes retirement and survivors’ insurance benefits, disability insurance, occupational accident insurance, and retirement pension.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Documents Required to Set Up an LLC in Switzerland</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Company Name of your wish (ending with “GmbH”)</li>
      <li>Passport color scan copy (director(s), shareholder(s))</li>
      <li>Proof of residence (phone bill, electricity bill) not older than 3 months</li>
      <li>Bank reference letter or 3-month bank statement</li>
      <li>Nature of business</li>
      <li>Business plan</li>
      <li>Details of the owner of the company - Our names, address, and other relevant details</li>
      <li>The activities that will be developed under the LLC</li>
      <li>A draft copy of the Articles of Association</li>
    </ol>

      Pension providers are commercial organizations that provide pension arrangements and services to pension schemes. Private pension schemes are ways for you or your employer to save money for later in your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 2 main types:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Defined contribution - a pension pot based on how much is paid in.</li>
      <li>Defined benefit - usually a workplace pension based on your salary and how long you’ve worked for your employer.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Pension Scheme Administration</h2>
    <p>
      You must register as a scheme administrator before you can apply to register a new pension scheme. Only the scheme administrator can apply to register the pension scheme.

    </p>
    <p>
      To become authorized as a claims management company, you will need to submit an application to the FCA, including a detailed business plan. You will also need to pay an application fee (£1,200 for smaller companies) and then an annual fee to maintain your authorization. These fees are to cover the FCA’s regulatory activities on claims management. Full details of the business plan requirements, application process, and fees can be found on the FCA website.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a firm that’s either considering becoming a Claims Management Company or already authorized as one, you should be aware of the FCA rules that apply. The rules on how you are expected to conduct your activity can largely be found in the FCA’s Claims Management: Conduct of Business sourcebook (referred to as ‘CMCOB’). There are also additional FCA rules that apply to all firms, including the complaint handling rules and rules on the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR).
    </p>
    <p>
      Applicant Claims Management Company seeking FCA authorization require a coherent compliance monitoring framework and must be able to demonstrate that the business model is one that meets the FCA’s requirements.

      The MFSA is responsible for the authorization and subsequent oversight of authorized Service Providers (Retirement Scheme Administrators, Investment Managers, and Custodians), Personal Retirement Schemes, Occupational Retirement Schemes ('Retirement Schemes'), and Retirement Funds in line with the Retirement Pensions Act, subsidiary legislation, and the Pension Rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supervision of Service Providers, Retirement Schemes, and Retirement Funds is carried out in a proportionate manner and comprises an appropriate combination of off-site and on-site supervision. In exercising its function and duties under the Retirement Pensions Act, the MFSA ensures that such duties are carried out in a transparent and accountable manner, taking into consideration the protection of members and beneficiaries, the promotion of competition and choice, and the reputation and suitability of the applicant and other connected parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current pension scheme in Malta is based on the Social Security Act, Chapter 318 of the Laws of Malta. The Act provides for two basic schemes, the Contributory Scheme, and the Non-Contributory Scheme. In the Contributory Scheme, the basic requirement for entitlement is that specific contribution conditions are satisfied. In the Non-Contributory Scheme, the basic requirement is that the conditions of the means test are satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Non-Contributory Scheme has made possible the allocation of more than one benefit at the same time, thus providing simultaneous coverage in those cases where more than one contingency is present. Through the process of targeting, this scheme has succeeded in the provision of additional assistance to certain specific categories such as, in the case of persons with a disability, in the case of single parents, as well as in the case of the family as a single unit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Contributory Scheme is universal since it practically covers all strata of the Maltese society. Within this scheme, employees, self-occupied, and self-employed persons acquire social insurance rights through the payment of a weekly contribution as laid down by the Social Security Act.

    <h2>State Funded Pension Scheme</h2>
    <p>
      The State funded pension scheme (2nd pension pillar) (SFPS) is a State organized set of measures for making contributions, administration of funds contributed and disbursement of pensions, which without increasing the total amount of contributions for old age pensions provides an opportunity to acquire additional pension capital by investing part of the contributions for old age pensions in financial instruments and other assets in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Law on State Funded Pensions.

      Management of contributions made to the funded pension scheme, further fruits (interest) and other assets may be performed by a manager of the funded pension scheme. Assets of the funded pension scheme may be managed by an investment management company registered in the Republic of Latvia or a branch of an investment management company registered in the European Union or European Economic Area which is opened in Latvia and is authorized to provide investment management services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commission shall process an application and take a decision regarding making an entry in the register of managers of the funded pension scheme assets or refusal to make a relevant entry within a 60-day period after submission of all the documents mentioned in Section 11.3 (1) and (2) of the Law on State Funded Pensions which are prepared and completed in compliance with the relevant requirements.

    <h1>Isle of Man Pensions</h1>
    <p>
      Upon taking responsibility for the supervision of retirement benefits schemes, the IPA set about conducting an extensive review of the Isle of Man's existing pensions legislation. Throughout this review, the IPA's objective was to provide a regulatory framework that not only encompassed domestic schemes available to Isle of Man residents but also provided a broader framework enabling multi-national or global businesses to use the Isle of Man as a center from which to manage retirement benefits schemes for employees who may reside anywhere in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to address the needs of these two diverse markets, the Retirement Benefits Schemes Act 2000 was enacted. This Act established a broad framework catering for all schemes operated in or from the Isle of Man. Separate sets of regulations have been introduced under the Retirement Benefits Schemes Act 2000 which make provision for international schemes (those being schemes that are managed from the Isle of Man yet which do not have any Isle of Man resident members) and domestic schemes which provide benefits for Isle of Man residents (albeit we may also provide benefits for non-Isle of Man residents for the purposes of registration under the Retirement Benefits Schemes Act 2000).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to legislation made under the Retirement Benefits Schemes Act 2000, certain retirement benefits schemes are also subject to Treasury legislation governing specific aspects of management and administration. Further information regarding Treasury pensions legislation is available on the Pensions News page of the Isle of Man Government’s website, and electronic versions of UK primary and secondary legislation applied to the Island by the Social Security Division of the Treasury in relation to pensions may be accessed from the Social Security Legislation page of the Treasury’s website.
    </p>
    <h2>Secondary Legislation Categories</h2>
    <p>The secondary legislation made under the Retirement Benefits Schemes Act 2000 falls into three categories:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>That which deals solely with international schemes;</li>
      <li>That which deals solely with domestic schemes; and</li>
      <li>That which is general in nature.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Domestic Schemes</h3>
    <p>
      The Retirement Benefits Schemes (Domestic Schemes) (General Administration) Regulations 2004, which came into operation on 1 November 2004, established an infrastructure concerned with the management and administration of domestic retirement benefits schemes authorized under the Retirement Benefits Schemes Act 2000. Domestic retirement benefits schemes must register with the Authority. Most domestic schemes must register as authorized schemes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Registration with the Authority, and compliance with the necessary registration requirements, does not confer tax-approved status upon a scheme. Information concerning tax approval and its associated conditions may be obtained from the Income Tax Division of Treasury. An application for the grant of tax-approved status, if required, may, however, be made on the appropriate registration application form.
    </p>
    <h3>International Retirement Benefits Schemes Framework</h3>
    <p>
      The Retirement Benefits Schemes (International Schemes) Regulations 2001, which took effect from January 2002, established an infrastructure concerned with the management and administration of international retirement benefits schemes authorized under the Retirement Benefits Schemes Act 2000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Registration with the Authority, and compliance with the necessary registration requirements, does not confer tax-approved status upon a scheme. Information concerning tax approval and its associated conditions may be obtained from the Income Tax Division of Treasury. An application for the grant of tax-approved status, if required, may, however, be made on the appropriate registration application form.

    <h1>Malta Securitization Vehicle</h1>
    <p>
      Malta’s Securitization Act (the “Act”) provides a legal framework for securitisation transactions that has been carefully designed to reflect both the specificities and wide variety of securitisation transactions brought to market. The Act provides statutory solutions and greater certainty of outcomes for many of the legal challenges that investors and credit rating agencies are typically concerned with, including true sale, bankruptcy remoteness and the privileges of securitisation creditors over the vehicle’s assets. The structural enhancements afforded to Maltese securitisation vehicles under the Act allow for competitive borrowing costs relative to any recognized issuer jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maltese securitisation vehicles can be used to structure various forms of securitisation transactions, including synthetic risk transfer securitisation, and a wide variety of asset-classes can be securitized, including credit card receivables, trade receivables, lease/charter payments for aircraft and ships, insurance risk, and income/royalty streams from intellectual property assets such as copyright, patents, and trademarks, to name a few.
    </p>
    <h2>Tax Neutrality</h2>
    <p>
      Malta has specific rules on the tax treatment of securitisation vehicles that enable them to achieve tax neutrality in respect of the securitisation transactions for which the vehicles are established. These tax rules can be applied to eliminate tax leakage for securitisation vehicles established in Malta and to ensure that there is no Maltese tax liability for originators that are not Malta tax resident.
    </p>
    <h2>Tax Treaties</h2>
    <p>
      Malta has an extensive Double Tax Treaty network in place with more than 65 Treaties currently in place.
    </p>
    <h3>Interest payments</h3>
    <p>
      No Maltese tax is payable on payments of interest by a securitisation vehicle to a holder of the vehicle’s securities that:
      <ol type="i">
        <li>is not resident in Malta;</li>
        <li>does not have a permanent establishment in Malta; and</li>
        <li>is not owned and controlled (directly or indirectly) by, or acts on behalf of, an individual who is ordinarily resident and domiciled in Malta.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Dividends</h3>
    <p>
      No Maltese tax is payable on the payment of dividends by a securitisation vehicle to its shareholders
    </p>
    <h3>Transfers of securities</h3>
    <p>
      No Maltese tax is payable on the transfer of any securities issued by a securitisation vehicle if the transferor is:
      <ol type="i">
        <li>not resident in Malta; and</li>
        <li>not owned and controlled (directly or indirectly) by, or acts on behalf of, an individual who is ordinarily resident and domiciled in Malta.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Stamp Duty</h3>
    <p>
      A securitisation vehicle established as a Maltese company qualifies for a stamp duty exemption where more than 90% of its business interests are situated outside Malta.
    </p>
    <h2>Absence of Regulatory Authorizations</h2>
    <p>
      Securitisation vehicles are specifically exempt from licensing or authorization requirements of any kind, irrespective of the kind of activities carried out by the vehicle, including where such activities would ordinarily require authorization (under the Investment Services Act or the Banking Act, for example).
    </p>
    <p>
      Securitisation vehicles are merely required to notify the MFSA of Our intent to enter into one or more securitisation transactions. The only exception is for a securitisation vehicle that (unusually) issues financial instruments to the public on a continuous basis, which would require authorization by the MFSA prior to issuing financial instruments to the public. Securitisation vehicles also qualify as financial vehicle corporations pursuant to Regulation (EU) 1075/2013 of the European Central Bank, with attendant quarterly statistical reporting requirements to the Central Bank of Malta.

  <h2>Belize Trading in Securities License</h2>
  <p>
    Belize is an independent country located in Central America, bordering Mexico and Guatemala. It enjoys a good reputation in financial services and is well-known internationally to banks and payment providers. Belize has implemented licensing legislation specifically focused on forex trading companies, regulated by the International Financial Services Commission of Belize (IFSC). This allows Belize to offer a full range of investment vehicles, making it an attractive jurisdiction for starting a business.
  </p>
  <h3>About License</h3>
  <p>
    The license permits entities to engage in trading and brokerage activities related to equity and debt securities, including acting as a broker for United States listed equities and other securities. Unlike some other licenses, such as foreign exchange licenses, the Trading in Securities License has broader coverage. It enables license holders to advise clients, manage investments, and perform tasks related to purchasing and selling stocks, bonds, and other securities.
  </p>
  <p>
    The International Financial Services Commission Act of 2011 regulates trading in financial and commodity-based derivative instruments and other securities in Belize. The services provided by the licensee must align with those offered by licensed brokers for trading in financial and commodity-based derivatives. License holders can engage in brokerage, consultancy, and advisory services related to various financial activities.

      <h2>Fiji Foreign Exchange Dealer Licence</h2>
      <p>
        The Fiji Islands are located in the region of Oceania. A company in Fiji is an excellent way for international entrepreneurs to conduct business in one of the world’s most rapidly growing economies. In contrast to classic offshore jurisdictions, Fiji Islands have a very positive reputation among investors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The company incorporated in Fiji Islands that wishes to conduct exchange business activities is required to hold a Foreign Exchange Dealer License granted by Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF). The license grants rights to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Sale, purchase and repatriation of travelers checks and foreign currency notes</li>
        <li>Remittance of the proceeds of repatriated Fiji currency notes</li>
        <li>Issue of bank drafts</li>
        <li>Use of telegraphic or electronic transfers for payment and receipt of funds</li>
        <li>Undertake matching of funds (transactions) to be restricted to Merchandise Imports</li>
        <li>Make payments in line with all currently delegated transactions as specified by the RBF</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There are three categories of Authorized Dealers in Fiji:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Money changers — who are restricted to foreign exchange dealings in travel related transactions only. Money changers are allowed to convert travellers’ cheques and foreign currency notes to Fijian currency and vice versa, remit proceeds of repatriated Fiji currency notes and issue bank drafts;
        </li>
        <li>
          Restricted foreign exchange dealers — who are allowed to conduct transactions permitted for money changers as well as additional transactions such as telegraphic or electronic transfers for payment and receipt of funds and any other payments as specified by the Reserve Bank;
        </li>
        <li>
          Fully authorized foreign exchange dealers — who are allowed to conduct all types of foreign exchange transactions. Commercial banks are classified as fully authorized foreign exchange dealers.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Advantages of Fiji</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Client Confidence: Companies rooted in Fiji exude credibility, instilling a sense of unwavering confidence in clients.</li>
        <li>Corporate Shareholding Flexibility: An environment that warmly embraces diverse corporate ownership structures, permitting corporate shareholders to engage actively.</li>
        <li>Confidentiality: A regulatory milieu characterized by an unwavering commitment to safeguarding the sacrosanct nature of confidentiality, with an impenetrable shield against prying eyes through the absence of publicly accessible records.</li>
        <li>AEOI Exemption: Fiji resolutely abstains from participating in the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI), guaranteeing a sanctuary of privacy and discretion.</li>

  <h2>South Africa OTC Derivative License</h2>
  <p><strong>OTC Definition:</strong> Over the counter (OTC) or off-exchange trading is done directly between two parties, without the supervision of an exchange. It is contrasted with exchange trading, which occurs via exchanges. A stock exchange has the benefit of facilitating liquidity, providing transparency, and maintaining the current market price. In an OTC trade, the price is not necessarily published for the public.</p>
  <p>OTC trading, as well as exchange trading, occurs with commodities, financial instruments (including stocks), and derivatives of such products. Products traded on the exchange must be well standardized. This means that exchanged deliverables match a narrow range of quantity, quality, and identity which is defined by the exchange and identical to all transactions of that product. This is necessary for there to be transparency in trading.</p>

  <h3>About South Africa’s OTC Derivatives Provider License</h3>
  <p>The FMA Regulations make it compulsory for all ODPs to be licensed. An ODP is “a person who as a regular feature of its business and transacting as principal:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>(a) Originates, issues or sells OTC derivatives; or</li>
    <li>(b) Makes a market in OTC derivatives”.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Further, the FMA Regulations define an “OTC derivative” as an unlisted derivative instrument that is executed, whether confirmed or not confirmed, excluding foreign exchange spot contracts and physically settled commodity derivatives.</p>

    <h1>Malta Protected Cell Companies</h1>
    <p>
      The Protected Cell Companies (PCC) Regulations as addressed by the Companies Act (Cell Companies Carrying on Business of Insurance) Regulations provide for the constitution, or conversion, of insurance companies, insurance brokers, and insurance managers licensed by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) into Cell Companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The PCC Regulations allow a cell company to be formed in carrying out business of insurance, reinsurance, captive, insurance brokerage, and insurance management. After successfully applying the concept of a PCC back in 2004, Malta’s PCC model allows the promoter to write insurance business through a cell by effectively utilizing the cell company’s core capital. This would then imply that the promoter need not comply with the “own funds” requirements if the cell company’s core capital is utilized effectively.
    </p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Type of law that regulates PCC is a hybrid type</li>
      <li>Time to establish a new company is 2 weeks</li>
      <li>Tax is 15%</li>
      <li>Number of Cells is unlimited</li>
      <li>Registered office is required</li>
      <li>Minimum paid-up capital is 50% of the Authorized capital</li>
      <li>Shares type is cellular and non-cellular</li>
      <li>Minimum number of directors is two</li>
      <li>Corporate directorship is not allowed</li>
      <li>Corporate secretary is required, or it must be a Malta Corporate Service Provider</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Malta PCC Distinctive Benefits</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>PCC as part of the business structure is ideal for use in umbrella funds and captive insurance structures because the losses of one cell will not have an adverse effect on the other cells</li>
      <li>It can limit the creditor exposure, the cells are independent, and the assets of a particular cell can be applied to the liabilities of that particular cell only</li>
      <li>It is cost-effective compared to forming various subsidiaries for different businesses</li>
      <li>Being the sole EU member with a separate legislation for Protected Cell Companies (PCCs) and Incorporated Cell Companies (ICCs), passport benefits within the EU/EEA, robust regulatory regime, and a favorable tax system favor Malta’s position for the carrying of business insurance, insurance management, and brokerage.</li>

    <h1>Czech Republic Branch Office</h1>
    <p>
      A branch office is not a separate legal entity, but functions as the representative of the establishing foreign company and incurs obligations on the foreign company's behalf. The law under which the branch's parent entity was founded also applies to the branch's internal dealings.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the establishment and the existence of the Czech branch office, it is necessary to authorize an individual as the Head of the Czech branch office. Such an individual shall be entered in the Czech Commercial Register and is entitled to undertake all acts concerning the branch office on behalf of the founder.
    </p>
    <h2>Features of a Branch Office</h2>
    <p>
      A branch is usually an adequate vehicle for low-cost projects. However, it is not the ideal choice for substantial projects because the parent company and branch office's activities are not differentiated, and the parent company is fully liable for the branch's liabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The branch must have the same name as the parent company.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Standard Czech corporate tax is 19%</li>
      <li>Annual tax returns should always be submitted</li>
      <li>No issued share capital required</li>
      <li>A resident director/manager is required</li>
      <li>Minimum number of directors is one</li>
      <li>A registered office is required</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      From a tax point of view, branches are permanent establishments of non-resident companies, and a Czech Republic branch is not a separate legal company from its parent.
    </p>
    <h2>Establishment of Czech Branch</h2>
    <p>
      Establishing a Czech branch office under Czech law involves two steps. The first step is to obtain an applicable Czech trade license or certificate (it depends upon the nature of each of the businesses to be carried out). The application shall be filed in the Czech Trade License Office for the geographic area within which the Czech branch office will have the registered office. The second step is the registration of the Czech branch office in the Czech Commercial Register. Legal entities from the EU do not have to mandatory register themselves in the Czech Commercial Register compared to legal entities from third countries. However, registration is in each case recommendable as it makes all dealings and processes in the Czech Republic much easier.

      The remote gaming regime applied by the MGA is both technology- and game-neutral, therefore encompassing any type of gaming offered by means of distance communication (including, but not limited to, internet, digital TV, mobile phone technology and telephony). Any game offered by means of distance communication, which can be securely managed and is compliant with the Regulations, will be reviewed and considered for licensing by the MGA.

      <li>Class 4 – To host and manage remote gaming operators, excluding the licensee themselves. This is intended for software vendors who want to provide management and hosting facilities on Our gaming platform.</li>

  <h2>Malta Gaming Licence</h2>

  <p>
    Over the past years Malta has successfully established itself as a leading, serious and well-regulated European remote gaming jurisdiction and is estimated to host around 10% of the world’s online gaming companies. The Government of Malta recognizes the importance of the proper regulation of this industry, and its relevance for Malta’s economy and, in-keeping with this recognition, continues to innovate the legal framework to keep up with industry and technological developments.
  </p>

  <h3>About the license</h3>

  <p>
    Malta is one of the largest and most respected regulated gambling markets in the world. The Malta Gambling Authority (MGA) issues licenses for a wide range of gambling activities including online casinos, sports betting, horse racing betting, and poker.
    The MGA license is a permit from the Malta Gambling Authority that allows you to engage in gambling activities. It is a sign of reliability and compliance with high industry standards.
  </p>

  <h3>License categories</h3>

  <p>
    Under the new legislative framework which effectively replaced and repealed the Remote Gaming Regulations, 2004, there are two broad categories of license which may be granted by the MGA:

    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Types of licenses</h3>

  <p>
    The MGA presents 4 classes of gambling licenses designed to provide operators with flexibility and diversity. Operators can determine which license category best meets their needs and strategic goals:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Type 1:</strong> Games of chance played against the house. Generally, casino type games such as roulette, blackjack, baccarat and E-sports is classified under Type 1.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Type 2:</strong> Games of chance played against the house with outcome determined by an event or competition separate from a game of chance. Games such as fixed odds betting and pool betting are classified under Type 2.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Type 3:</strong> Games of chance not played against the house, with the operator being protected to gaming risk. Instead of profiting from the game, the operate generates revenue by taking a commission or charging based on the stakes of the price. Games such as poker, bingo are classified under Type 3.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Type 4:</strong> Controlled skill games such as fantasy sports are classified under Type 4.

      <h2>BVI Money Service Business License</h2>

      <p>
        Money Services Business (MSB) refers to financial services that involve the acceptance of cash, cheques, other monetary instruments or other stores of value, and the payment of a corresponding sum in cash or other form to a beneficiary by means of a communication, message, transfer, or through a clearing network to which the MSB belongs. Transactions performed by such services can involve one or more intermediaries and a final payment to a third party, and may include any new payment methods.
      </p>

      <h3>About the license</h3>

      <p>
        Money services business (MSB) in the Virgin Islands is regulated by the Financial Services Commission (“the Commission”) under the Financing and Money Services Act, 2009. Entities which wish to provide MSB must be duly licensed by the Commission and must adhere to all regulatory legislation, including the Anti‐money Laundering Regulations, 2008 and the Anti‐ money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Code of Practice, 2008.
      </p>

      <h3>Permitted activities</h3>

      <p>
        The Financing and Money Services Act, 2009 (“the Act”), defines Money Service Business to describe the following activities:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Money transmission services</li>
        <li>Cheque cashing services</li>
        <li>Currency exchange services</li>
        <li>The issuance, sale or redemption of money orders or traveller’s cheques</li>
        <li>Operating as an agent or franchise holder of a person carrying on any business specified above</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        MSBs can only be conducted in, or from within, the Virgin Islands, by an entity established as a BVI Business Company (BVIBC) or a foreign company, and must be duly licensed by the Commission. An MSB is licensed by the Commission after satisfying the requirements of the Act. In accordance with the Act, where a BVIBC carries on, or holds itself out as carrying on, money services business outside the Virgin Islands, it is considered to be carrying on, or holding itself out as carrying on money services business from within the VI, and is therefore subject to all licensing requirements.
      </p>

      <h3>Categories of license</h3>

      <p>
        Previously, the licenses available under Financing and Money Services Act (FMSA) were:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Class A: which allows a licensee to carry on business of transmitting money in any form, including electronic and mobile payments of money</li>
        <li>Class B: which allows a licensee to carry on the business of issuing, selling or redeeming money orders or travelers cheques, cheque cashing and currency exchange</li>
        <li>Class C: which allows a licensee to engage in financing business</li>
        <li>Class D: which allows a licensee to carry on the business of financing lease</li>
        <li>Class E: which allows a licensee to carry on the business of operating an ATM</li>
        <li>Class F: which allows a licensee to carry on the business of international financing and lending in the peer-to-peer (P2P) FinTech market, including peer to business (P2B) and business-to-business (B2B) markets</li>
        <li>Class G: which allows a licensee to carry on the business of such other service as may be specified on the regulations</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Amendments to FMSA</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Maintenance of capital resources and deposit:
          <p>
            If a licensee’s capital resources fall below the level prescribed amount, as well as notifying the Commission, the licensee must prepare and submit a plan showing how it intends to rebuild its capital resource to the requisite level. A licensee generally has up to 30 days to reconstitute its capital and, if it fails to do so, the Commission can take enforcement action, including revocation or cancellation of the relevant licence.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Duty of management to ensure licensee complies with law:
          <p>
            Every director, senior officer and person concerned in the management of a licensee must take all reasonable steps to ensure it complies with FMSA and any legislation relating to money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing. Failure to take all reasonable steps is an offence and can lead to a penalty of US$30,000 for an individual.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Segregating customer accounts:
          <p>
            Licensees which receive money from a customer for transmission or delivery to a payee customer must establish a separate customer account, which must be segregated from the licensee’s own account.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          No solicitation or receipt of money:
          <p>
            No one may solicit or receive money from another person for the purpose of carrying on money services business or financing business in or from within the BVI unless licensed or exempt under FMSA. To do so is an offence and can lead to a penalty of US$50,000 for an individual or US$75,000 for corporate and other entities.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Consumer protection measures:
          <p>
            The Commission may provide consumer measures for money services and financing businesses, including placing restrictions on interest rates charged, allowing or requiring instalment payments, limiting excessive charges and requiring loan statements and receipts to be provided to customers.
          </p>

  <h2>Canada Money Service Business License</h2>
  <p>
    As the world’s tenth-largest economy, Canada has established a resilient financial system that confidently survived the recent global financial crises. Anchored in this strong economic foundation, Canada features one of the most robust and dependable banking systems worldwide. A pivotal element contributing to the banking system’s success is the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC) of Canada. Tasked as the financial intelligence unit, FINTRAC is responsible for preventing and combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Consequently, Canadian businesses offering money services are mandated to register and operate under the supervision of FINTRAC.
  </p>

  <h3>About the License</h3>
  <p>
    To obtain a Money Services Business (MSB) license in Canada, businesses must register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC). This registration is crucial for businesses that intend to offer money services in Canada, which include foreign exchange dealing, money transferring, issuing or redeeming money orders, traveler’s checks, or anything similar.
  </p>

  <h3>Permitted Activities</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Offering foreign exchange dealing (exchange of one type of currency for another)</li>
    <li>Conducting foreign exchange transactions (cross-border transfer funds for individuals and business owners)</li>
    <li>Remitting or transmitting funds (card payments and transfers via a terminal or an online payment gateway solution)</li>
    <li>Issuing or redeeming money orders (cash on demand received from a bank, post office, Walmart, grocery store, etc.)</li>
    <li>Working with virtual currency (offer digital assets exchange and virtual currency transfer services)</li>
    <li>Issuing personal accounts (issuance of personalized e-wallets, allowing your customers to store the funds or deposit and pay securely)</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>MSB Vs FMSB</h3>
  <p>
    A person is required to register as an MSB under FINTRAC in case it intends to offer one or a combination of MSB services to the public and has a place of business in Canada. On the contrary, a person is required to register as a Foreign MSB (FMSB) under FINTRAC, in case it intends to offer one or more MSB services and does not have a place of business in Canada.

  <h2>Cyprus Payment Institution License</h2>
  <p>
    The financial services sector in Cyprus has been growing rapidly over the past years, with the island nation positioning itself as an attractive destination for companies seeking to establish a presence within the European Union. Among the many financial services available, the establishment of a Payment Institution (PI) in Cyprus is becoming increasingly popular.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cyprus permits the provision of payment services by Payment Institutions (PIs) and Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs), which must be licensed and authorised by the Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) before offering any payment services. PIs and EMIs authorised by the CBC can effectively offer their services throughout the EU under the “passporting” conditions of their authorisation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The key pieces of legislation governing the licensing and operation of PIs in Cyprus are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Business of Electronic Money Law (2012) as amended.</li>
    <li>The Provision and Use of Payment Services and Access to Payment Systems Law (2018) (implementing PSD2).</li>
    <li>The Central Bank of Cyprus Directive on the Authorisation and Supervision of Payment Institutions (2019).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Permitted Activities</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Services enabling cash to be placed on a payment account as well as all the operations required for operating a payment account.</li>
    <li>Services enabling cash withdrawals from a payment account as well as all the operations required for operating a payment account.</li>
    <li>Execution of payment transactions, including transfers of funds on a payment account with the user’s payment service provider or with another payment service provider:
      <ol>
        <li>Execution of direct debits, including one-off direct debits.</li>
        <li>Execution of payment transactions through a payment card or a similar device.</li>
        <li>Execution of credit transfers, including standing orders.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Execution of payment transactions where the funds are covered by a credit line for a payment service user:
      <ol>
        <li>Execution of direct debits, including one-off direct debits.</li>
        <li>Execution of payment transactions through a payment card or a similar device.</li>
        <li>Execution of credit transfers, including standing orders.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Issuing of payment instruments and/or acquiring of payment transactions.</li>
    <li>Money remittance.</li>
    <li>Payment initiation services.</li>
    <li>Account information services.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    In this regard, the difference between an EMI from a PSP is that an EMI can be licensed to provide all the payment services and activities stated above and in addition, issue and offer electronic money. Electronic money (e-money) is a digital alternative to cash. It allows users to make cashless payments with money stored on a card or a phone, or over the internet.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Benefits of PI License in Cyprus</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Cyprus’ attractive tax regime with net profits being subject to one of the lowest corporate taxes in Europe and sales of titles and dividends being tax exempted. Furthermore, non-residents enjoy no withholding tax in dividends, interest and royalties and may take advantage of more than 60 double tax treaties that the republic has secured.</li>
    <li>A broad network of professionals offering high-quality legal, compliance, accounting and banking services, allocating financial resources in a cost-efficient manner.</li>
    <li>The opportunity to provide services across the EU, through the EU passporting framework, without seeking additional authorisation or establishing a branch in another member state.</li>

    <h2>Hong Kong Payment System License</h2>
<p>Hong Kong attracts a large number of fintech projects, payment systems are no exception. Since 2015, special regulation has been in effect in Hong Kong, which stimulated the receipt of payment system licenses in Hong Kong. Approval from and reporting to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is required to obtain such a license.</p>
<h2>Types of payment system license</h2>
<h3>Two types of payment systems:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Money Service Operator (MSO);</li>
  <li>Stored Value Facility (SVF).</li>
</ol>
<p>MSO can carry out money transfers and currency exchanges, and their possible actions are significantly limited. SVF can carry out actions including with electronic money. There are similar types of licenses in European regulation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The functions of the Cash Operator are similar to those of the Payment Institution;</li>
  <li>The SVF license complies with the Electronic Money Issuer (EMI) license.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, in order to provide more services to your customers, it is better to obtain an SVF license, but the process of obtaining a license will be both more complicated and expensive.</p>
<p>With an SVF license, the system can carry out the following activities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Keeping money</li>
  <li>Means of payment for goods and services</li>
  <li>Means of payment to another person</li>
</ol>
<h3>Permitted activities</h3>
<p>Here is a list of allowed activities with an EMI license, they include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Services enabling cash to be deposited/withdrawn into a payment account for operations, which are required for operating a payment account.</li>
  <li>Completion of payment transactions, including transfers of funds from a payment account with the user’s payment service provider or with another payment service provider:</li>
  <li>Completion of direct debits, including one-off direct debits;</li>
  <li>Completion of payment transactions through a payment card or a similar device;</li>
  <li>Completion of credit transfers, including standing orders.</li>
  <li>Completion of payment transactions where the funds are covered by a credit line for a payment service user:</li>
  <li>Issuing of payment instruments and/or acquiring of payment transactions.</li>
  <li>Money remittance.</li>
  <li>Payment initiation and account information services.</li>
  <li>Issuing e-money, provision of operational services and closely related ancillary services or provision of payment services.</li>
  <li>Operation of payment systems.</li>
  <li>Business activities other than issuance of electronic money, with regards to the applicable Community and national law, etc.</li>

  <h2>Panama EMI License</h2>
  <p>E-Money institutions (EMI) allow you to hold electronic money. To do so you need to have an E-money license. <br></br><br></br>E-money institutions can be organized in Panama as Financial Services Companies. These are special types of Panama Corporation (IBC), that were granted an “Aviso'' by the Ministry of Commerce. This is a special license that allows these companies to do certain financial transactions.<br></br><br></br> In Panama, Money Remittance Operators (MRO) activities are regulated by the Directorate of Financial Companies of the Ministry of Commerce and Industries as determined by Law 48 of June 23rd of 2003 and Resolution 328 of August 9th of 2004.</p>
  
  <p>Some of the activities that a Financial Services Company can perform are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Payment processing for any third-party.</li>
    <li>Act as an intermediary for payment processing.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>However, it is important to note that a Financial Service Company is not a financial institution, and it should be strictly used for payment processing.</p>

  <p>In order to get a Financial Services Company, you must obtain permission to offer financial services from the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The application must be submitted by a lawyer which has the right to practice law in the country.</p>

    <h1>United Kingdom Banking License</h1>
    <p>
      The primary source of framework legislation governing the regulation of banking and financial services in the UK is the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA).
    </p>
    <p>
      The regulation of banks in the UK is undertaken by three main regulators, the:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Bank of England (BoE)</li>
      <li>Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), a division of the BoE</li>
      <li>Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The PRA and the FCA are the lead bank regulators. The BoE is the resolution authority, with primary responsibility for regulatory intervention and exercise of resolution powers in relation to banks that are failing or likely to fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The PRA's primary objective is to promote the safety and soundness of those institutions authorized by the PRA by seeking to ensure that Our business is carried on in a way which avoids any adverse effect on the stability of the UK financial system. Its secondary objective is facilitating effective competition in the markets for services provided by those institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The FCA is responsible for conduct of business, effective financial markets, consumer protection, and for promoting effective competition.
    </p>
    <h2>Bank License</h2>
    <p>
      In order to become the owner of a certificate for conducting banking activities, it is necessary to register own company in the territory of England. Based on the characteristics of various organizational and legal forms, it is possible to conclude that the best structure for development in Great Britain is LLC or OJSC (LTD).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Requirements and process of obtaining a license:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Personnel, in particular the executive director, should submit documents on education, as well as a certificate of proper qualifications and extract from the employment record book with confirmation of work experience in managerial positions to the expert commission. During the corporation's period of operation, the director should reside in the territory of England, and the regulator reserves the right to verify the location of the manager by phone or through the Internet. In case of violations, the license can be revoked.</li>
      <li>The founder of LLC can be a natural person, and there are no requirements regarding his citizenship and location. In addition to the executive director, another manager is appointed, and he can be non-resident, and an employee who provides continuous support of communication with the regulator shall be also appointed.</li>
      <li>Obtaining a license is impossible without having a physical office in Great Britain. In addition to the presence of the building, basic communications, including Internet and telephony, should be carried out.</li>
      <li>The structure should function and be fully suitable for work. The amount of the authorized capital depends on the scope of activities of the firm.</li>
      <li>Applications are made to the PRA, and include a number of detailed application forms, including a permission table that sets out Part 4A Permissions by function and (in certain cases) by client type. Although the PRA manages a single administrative process, the FCA also assesses the applicant firm from a conduct perspective and authorization is granted only if both regulators are satisfied.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>The following are the stages in authorization of new banks:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Pre-application</strong> – this is an optional stage where firms engage with us early on in order to develop Our propositions and prepare Our applications to set up a new bank. This stage comprises three meetings: initial, feedback, and technical challenge.</li>
      <li><strong>Application</strong> – submitting an application to BOE to assess and decide whether to authorize them as a new bank and to set Our capital and liquidity requirements; the assessment of a new bank application is PRA/FCA led and at the time firms submit such an application we should start developing Our operational capabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Mobilization</strong> – an optional stage in which new banks, once authorized, operate with deposit restrictions while we complete the final aspects of Our set up before starting to trade fully. Firms lead the completion of mobilization actions and operational capabilities, while the PRA/FCA lead on the assessment of whether a firm is ready to exit mobilization and become fully operational.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The total application fee is currently £50,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      The PRA and the FCA require that prospective banks meet Our respective threshold conditions. These include the following requirements:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Legal status: Deposit-takers must be corporates or partnerships.</li>
      <li>Location of offices: A UK incorporated corporate body must maintain Our head offices and, if one exists, Our registered office in the UK.</li>
      <li>Prudent conduct of business: The firm must conduct Our business in a prudent manner, which includes having appropriate financial and non-financial resources.</li>
      <li>Suitability: The firm must satisfy the PRA that we are a ‘fit and proper’ person with regard to all circumstances to conduct a regulated activity.</li>
      <li>Effective supervision: The firm must be capable of being effectively supervised by the PRA.</li>
      <li>Effective supervision: The firm must be capable of being effectively supervised by the FCA.</li>
      <li>Appropriate non-financial resources: The firm’s non-financial resources must be appropriate in relation to the regulated activities we seek to carry on, having regard to the FCA’s operational objectives.</li>
      <li>Suitability: The firm must be a fit and proper person. The firm’s management must have adequate skills and experience and act with integrity (fitness and propriety). The firm must have appropriate policies and procedures in place and it must appropriately manage conflicts of interest.</li>
      <li>Business model: The firm’s strategy for doing business must be suitable for a person carrying on the regulated activities it undertakes or seeks to carry on and must not pose a risk to the FCA’s objectives.</li>

    <h1>Luxembourg Central Securities Depositories (CSDs)</h1>
    <p>
      An international CSD is a central securities depository that settles trades in international securities such as eurobonds although many also settle trades in various domestic securities, usually through direct or indirect (through local agents) links to local CSDs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) are responsible for the registration and safekeeping of securities as well as the settlement of securities in exchange for cash through Our securities settlement system. We track how many securities have been issued, by whom these securities have been issued, and who is the owner of these securities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luxembourg’s central Bank, the Banque centrale du Luxembourg, and Clearstream, the Luxembourg-based ICSD today launched LuxCSD, a new central securities depository service for Luxembourg and beyond. Luxembourg is a leading center for the issuance and distribution of Investment funds with EUR 1.8 trillion of net assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also the pre-eminent center for cross-border collateral securing monetary policy operations with 38% of all cross-border collateral being pledged to the Eurosystem via Clearstream Banking Luxembourg and the BCL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Point (1) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 of 23 July 2014 on improving securities settlement in the European Union and on central securities depositories (CSDR) defines a CSD as “a legal person that operates a securities settlement system referred to in point (3) of Section A of the Annex and provides at least one other core service listed in Section A of the Annex,” notably:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Initial recording of securities in a book-entry system (“notary service”)</li>
      <li>Providing and maintaining securities accounts at the top-tier level (“central maintenance service”)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In order to be authorized as CSD, an applicant CSD needs to comply with the obligations laid down in the CSDR as well as the obligations set out in the related regulatory technical standards (RTS) and implementing technical standards (ITS).
    </p>
    <p>
      A CSD can apply to the CSSF for the following authorizations:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Authorization as CSD in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 17 of the CSDR</li>
      <li>Extension and outsourcing of activities and services in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 19 of the CSDR</li>
      <li>Provision of banking-type ancillary services in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 55 of the CSDR</li>
      <li>Extension of the banking-type ancillary services in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 56 of the CSDR</li>

    <h1>Isle of Man Deposit Taking</h1>
    <p>
      There are three separate types of license that permit a business operating in or from the Isle of Man to undertake banking or deposit-taking activities:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Class 1(1)</strong> Accepting deposits of money from any person, including persons that are not restricted depositors, where;
        <ol>
          <li>the money received by way of deposit is lent to others; or</li>
          <li>any other activity of the person accepting the deposit is financed wholly, or to a material extent, out of the capital of or interest on the money received by way of deposit.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Class 1(2)</strong> Accepting deposits of money solely from persons who are restricted depositors, where;

      All Class 1(1) deposit-takers must be members of the Depositors' Compensation Scheme except for certain banks and building societies that may be exempted if we do not take retail deposits.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unrestricted banking license permits a bank to conduct a full range of banking business with customers both in the Isle of Man and elsewhere. The license holder must have a real presence on the Isle of Man, including:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Management and staff</li>
      <li>Discrete and secure premises</li>
      <li>Adequate systems and resources to conduct banking business</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Managed License holders employ the services of another licensed bank in the Isle of Man, the 'Approved Manager,' to provide the day-to-day management and administrative functions to it. The managed license holder may not employ any staff in the Island without the consent of the Commission and must operate from the premises of the 'Approved Manager.'

    <h1>Guernsey Banking License</h1>
    <p>
      The Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) expects new banks entering the Guernsey market to be reputable, of good standing, and with an established track record in banking. Any bank wishing to establish a presence in Guernsey must make an application under the Banking Supervision (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 1994, as amended (Banking Law).
    </p>
    <p>
      Application for registration must be made to the GFSC. The GFSC has the discretion to refuse and revoke licenses and to attach conditions to registration. When considering whether to grant an application for a banking license, the GFSC must be satisfied that the applicant, and any person who is or is to be a director, controller, or manager of the applicant, meets the minimum criteria for licensing. The criteria include:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>the applicant must be an institution;</li>
      <li>the business of the applicant is/will be carried on with prudence, professional skill, and integrity appropriate to the nature and scale of its activities and in a manner that will not bring the Bailiwick of Guernsey into disrepute as an international finance center;</li>
      <li>the Bailiwick of Guernsey is deriving/will derive economic benefit from the applicant’s operation to an extent acceptable to the GFSC;</li>
      <li>every person who is or is to be a director, controller, or manager of the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold that position. In determining this, the GFSC will consider, amongst other things:
        <ol>
          <li>his probity, competence, experience, and soundness of judgment for filling that position;</li>
          <li>the diligence with which he is fulfilling or likely to fulfill those responsibilities; and</li>
          <li>his knowledge and understanding of the legal and professional obligations to be assumed or undertaken;</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>at least two individuals resident in the Bailiwick and of appropriate standing and experience shall effectively direct the business of the applicant; and</li>
      <li>the applicant is/will conduct its business in a prudent manner.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      As a rough guide, an applicant should have at least £1 million of assets although, as the GFSC requires Guernsey banks to maintain a minimum risk asset ratio of 8%, many banks have higher minimum risk asset requirements. Banks are required to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio of 8.5% (comprising a 6% requirement plus a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer) for Pillar 1. Pillar 2 capital should be comprised of at least 75% CET1.
    </p>
    <h2>Requirements and Features</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Corporate vehicle permitted is a Guernsey company</li>
      <li>Minimum paid-up capital is USD 1,000,000</li>
      <li>Minimum number of directors is two</li>
      <li>Minimum number of shareholders is two</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tax Treatment</h2>
    <p>
      There is no capital, value-added, or inheritance taxes in Guernsey, nor any stamp or document duties except in respect of Guernsey real property. With the exception of certain businesses, companies (including funds) now pay a standard rate of 0% income tax on profits. Funds still have the option to apply for exempt company status (on payment of an annual fee of £600).
    </p>
    <h2>Duration to Set Up</h2>
    <p>3 months</p>
    <h2>Distinctive Benefits of License</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Robust yet flexible regulatory environment</li>
      <li>Professional infrastructure and quality of workplace</li>
      <li>Tax neutrality and Tax Exchange Agreements</li>

  <h1>Gibraltar Banking Licence</h1>
  <p>
    Banking is one of the major pillars of the Gibraltar economy with total assets over EUR 7.8 billion and some of the major International banks have their offices in Gibraltar. The banking sector is regulated by the Financial Services Commissioner appointed by the Governor of Gibraltar on behalf of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Financial Services (Banking) Act 2019 (the “Act”), and supporting regulations, in accordance with relevant EU directives, provides the legal framework for the supervision of deposit takers who provide banking services in or from within Gibraltar either as a Gibraltar incorporated legal entity or a branch of a deposit taker authorized in either EEA State or a Third country.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Credit Institution (more commonly referred to as a bank) receives deposits or other repayable funds from the public and grants credits. Credit Institutions that are permissioned in Gibraltar are also required to be members of the Deposit Guarantee Scheme.
  </p>

  <h2>Permitted Activities</h2>
  <p>

      <h2>Vanuatu Banking Licence</h2>

      <p>
        The Republic of Vanuatu is an island located in the South Pacific long known as an international offshore financial services center. Vanuatu emerges as a premier destination for global finance, particularly for those seeking to establish offshore banking operations. Situated in the Pacific, this jurisdiction offers a unique blend of regulatory oversight, financial privacy, and strategic advantages for international banking.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Republic of Vanuatu is an ideal location for the formation of an offshore bank. Vanuatu offers an International Bank License which covers all related banking activities, including accepting deposits and issuing debit cards. The licensure is recognized world-wide and is both cost effective and can be accomplished quickly. The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu is the body responsible for receiving and evaluating applications for an offshore banking license and all supporting documents, and for assessing whether an individual/legal entity is “appropriate”. International Banking is regulated by the International Banking Act [CAP. 280].
      </p>

      <h3>Strategic Advantages of a Vanuatu Banking License</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Global Reputation and Reliability: A long-standing presence in the offshore services sector underscores Vanuatu’s reliability and quality.</li>
        <li>Asset Protection and Privacy: The jurisdiction allows for the establishment of foreign accounts, ensuring significant asset protection and confidentiality.</li>
        <li>International Client Engagement: License holders can cater to a diverse global clientele, expanding their financial services reach.</li>
        <li>Operational Flexibility: Vanuatu’s regulatory environment permits considerable flexibility in financial operations and business model development.</li>
        <li>Ideal for Emerging Businesses: The jurisdiction is particularly attractive for start-ups and SMEs, thanks to lower initial capital requirements and favorable tax conditions.</li>

      The Foreign Exchange Act mainly governs the activities of so-called foreign exchange entities carrying out cash bureau-de-change activities (non-cash exchange is governed by the Payment System Act). In addition, this act imposes some obligations on residents and non-residents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every country, there are many different companies operating on the money exchange market, in just the same way as any other service business. These money exchange companies can be anything from one-off operations to major global brands, but all have to be regulated by the National Bank of the country in which it operates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supervision of bureaux-de-change is an integral part of maintaining the stability of the financial system in the Czech Republic and promoting its sound and smooth development. In the case of bureau-de-change activity, this means in particular strengthening the credibility and soundness of bureau-de-change service provision, including compliance with rules of transparent exchange rate disclosure. Bureaux-de-change are classed as risky also because we can be misused for money laundering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bureau-de-change activity, where not carried on by a credit institution, may only be performed by a natural person or legal entity registered by the Czech National Bank. Persons carrying on bureau-de-change activity on the basis of a license issued by a trade licensing office or a foreign exchange license were allowed to carry on such activity on the basis of such authorizations only until 28 February 2010. Thereafter we were obliged to terminate such activity or apply to the CNB for registration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain requirements are imposed on new enterprises, such as: the IP cannot act as an investment company or securities firm. Brokerage licenses are issued only to LLCs or JSCs. Regardless of the type of firm, the minimum amount of the authorized capital is set at 125 thousand euros.

      <li>Foreign-exchange markets;</li>
      <li>Banks, pawnbroker's offices, certain insurance companies with an extended scope of financial instruments.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Permission for investment activities is granted only to legal entities. If a natural person submits an application to obtain this type of certificate, we should complete the registration procedures for Our own company and open a bank account in the Czech Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast to non-residents, local entrepreneurs do not need to organize a new company. The certificate is issued to such forms of companies as LLC and JSC, and the applicant from among individual entrepreneurs (IP) is obliged to apply to lawyers to change the organizational form of the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      The total amount of services for processing the license for financial activities in the Czech Republic depends on the individual set of operations required for licensing in a particular case.

      Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties, and trade repositories came into force on 16 August 2012 and introduced requirements aimed at improving the transparency of OTC derivatives markets and reducing the risks associated with those markets.

      In order to achieve this, EMIR requires that OTC derivatives meeting certain requirements are subject to the clearing obligation, and for all OTC derivatives that are not centrally cleared, risk mitigation techniques apply. In addition, all derivatives transactions need to be reported to trade repositories (TRs). Finally, EMIR establishes organizational conduct of business and prudential standards for both trade repositories (TRs) and central counterparties (CCPs).

      A license is needed to operate as an investment firm, and this is issued by Finantsinspektsioon. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Applying for an operating license as an investment firm: The operating license is not time-limited, is non-transferable, and may not be acquired or used by anybody else. Operating licences are issued either separately for the provision of some investment services or for all investment services. Investment firms may provide only those investment services for which we have an operating license. To provide other investment services, the investment firm must apply for an additional operating license.
    </p>
    <p>
      To apply for an operating license, an application must be submitted to Finantsinspektsioon comprising a written notification and the annexes listed in the Securities Market Act. The decision to issue an operating license or to refuse it is taken by Finantsinspektsioon within two months after all the necessary documentation and data have been received, and not later than six months after the application for the operating license has been received.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an investment firm registered in Estonia wants to establish a subsidiary or branch to provide investment services in a foreign country or to take a large enough holding in an investment firm from a foreign country to make that into a subsidiary, it must apply to Finantsinspektsioon for permission to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Providing cross-border investment services in Estonia: Neither the provider of cross-border investment services itself nor its branch need be registered in Estonia. Investment firms registered in the European Economic Area may start to provide cross-border investment services in Estonia after the securities markets supervisory institution of the firm’s home country has forwarded to Finantsinspektsioon a notification of this with the business plan and description of planned services. The investment firm providing cross-border investment services must give notification in writing of proposed changes to business plan in good time to both Finantsinspektsioon and the securities markets supervisory institution of its home country.

    <h1>Gibraltar Bureaux De Change</h1>
    <p>
      A Bureau de Change is an establishment at which customers primarily exchange foreign currency. This regulated activity allows you to offer currency exchange services as a Bureau de Change, and this permission is granted under Part 7 of the Financial Services Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      To apply for this permission, applicants should submit an application pack along with all relevant documents. Currently, there are no specific capital requirements for bureaux de change. However, it is expected that firms hold at least three months' worth of expenses to ensure an orderly wind-down of the firm in the event of closure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business plan submitted should clearly and comprehensively outline:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>How the firm will ensure compliance with all anti-money laundering requirements.</li>
      <li>How the firm assesses the risks associated with money laundering.</li>
      <li>Internal controls in place to mitigate the identified risks, particularly those associated with money laundering.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) will evaluate the application and seek evidence that the firm has considered and documented the risk, compliance, and operational issues associated with the proposed activities. It is important that the business plan aligns with the firm's risk appetite and capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The regulation and supervision of bureaux de change primarily aim to counter the risks of money laundering associated with this industry, thereby enhancing and protecting Gibraltar's reputation as a leading finance center. Therefore, applicants should ensure strict adherence to anti-money laundering requirements, especially as outlined in the GFSC's AML/CFT Guidance Notes.

    <h1>Isle Of Man Crowdfunding Platforms</h1>
    <p>
      Crowdfunding is the process by which individuals or businesses seek to raise money from a variety of sources other than traditional funding sources such as high street banks and building societies. Most often, those seeking investment through crowdfunding aim to reach a wide audience, including the general public and institutional investors, who collectively form the "crowd" from whom investment is sought. In this context, the person seeking funds for a project is the "investee," and the person investing money into the project is the "investor."
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common method for investees to attract crowdfunding is by registering on a website or online portal known as a crowdfunding platform. Once registered, the investee's business model or project becomes available for all users of the platform to view and decide whether we wish to invest Our funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Isle of Man, there is some overlap between loan-based crowdfunding and the Moneylenders Act 1991. Companies that lend money to individuals are required to register with the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Crowdfunding handbook is produced to provide license holders with a Class 6 Permission under the Financial Services Act 2008 (those licensed by the Isle of Man Financial Services Authority) conducting equity or loan-based crowdfunding in or from the Isle of Man, as well as potential license holders and other interested parties, with easy access to the legislation and guidance related to regulated crowdfunding activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary legislation governing Crowdfunding Platforms in or from the Isle of Man is the Financial Services Act 2008.
    </p>
    <p>
      To obtain a Class 6 license and protect investors, crowdfunding platforms must have a paid-up share capital of at least £25,000 and demonstrate tangible net resources of at least £50,000. The FSA imposes strict conditions on Class 6 license holders, including a prohibition on providing recommendations or advice without a Class 2 license, a requirement to display a prominent warning on the crowdfunding platform about the risks of crowdfunding, and conducting due diligence checks on borrowers and lenders and having written terms of business with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distinctive benefits of crowdfunding in Isle of Man: The Isle of Man offers an attractive package for crowdfunding platforms to establish operations here. The Island has a world-class professional services industry, highly regulated, and the Isle of Man Government is proactive in encouraging business to flourish, including assisting non-Isle of Man businesses in moving to the Island. Frequent air and ferry links to the UK and Ireland are available, and the Isle of Man benefits from attractive personal and corporate taxation rates.

    <h1>Isle Of Man Special Purpose Vehicles / Insurance Linked Securities</h1>
    <p>
      Insurance Special Purpose Vehicles (ISPVs): In March 2015, the Isle of Man Financial Services Authority introduced regulations, supported by guidance notes, to establish a regulatory framework for transactions commonly known as Insurance Linked Securities (ILS). These transactions include Catastrophe Bonds, Mortality Bonds, Industry Loss Warranties, Sidecars, and other collateralized insurance and reinsurance structures. This framework facilitates such transactions through ISPVs, which are insurance or reinsurance companies specifically licensed by the Authority for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key differences between an ISPV and a conventional insurer or reinsurer include the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>An ISPV must only have (re)insureds and investors who are suitably sophisticated for this specialized form of business. Qualifying criteria for prospective participants can be found in the ISPV regulations and guidance.</li>
      <li>An ISPV must be fully funded through contractual arrangements with its participants, limiting the ISPV's liability to its available assets. This reduced risk to stakeholders and lower risk of insolvency result in simplified regulatory requirements and lower fees for ISPVs.</li>
      <li>An ISPV must be administered by an insurance manager registered under Part 6 of the Insurance Act 2008.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The ISPV application process is designed for fast licensing, with a target of 5 days or less from a fully completed application. Details regarding an application to be licensed as an Insurance Special Purpose Vehicle can be found in the Insurance (Special Purpose Vehicles) Regulations 2015 and the Guidance Notes for Insurance Special Purpose Vehicles (available on the FSA website).

      On receipt of the application staff of the Authority will process the application. This will include a review of the application form and supporting documents such as the business plan and financial projections, and, if appropriate, discussion with other regulatory bodies. The assessment process for license applicants involves a thorough evaluation to ensure the Authority’s fitness and propriety criteria, including integrity, competence, and financial standing, are met. This evaluation will be carried out in accordance with the Authority's Licensing Policy for Regulated Activities under the Financial Services Act 2008 (“licensing policy”).

    <h1>Malta Financial Institutions</h1>
    <p>
      The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) is responsible for supervising entities authorized under the Financial Institutions Act (Cap. 376). These entities, referred to as 'financial institutions,' can be categorized into two broad categories:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Institutions undertaking payment services and/or the issuance of electronic money, commonly known as 'payment institutions' or 'electronic money institutions,' respectively.</li>
      <li>Financial institutions undertaking other activities such as lending, financial leasing, providing guarantees and commitments, foreign exchange services, and money brokering.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The Financial Institutions Act 1994 (the Act) is closely related to the Banking Act 1994 and covers institutions engaged in activities listed in the Schedule to Article 2 of the Act, but do not accept deposits from or other funds repayable to the public. The Act provides financial institutions with operational flexibility while subjecting them to continuous supervision and regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Licensing Requirements: No financial institution can conduct its business without a license. The competent authority has the final say in determining whether a financial institution's business is in compliance with regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Application for a license must adhere to the format required in the Financial Institutions Directive (FID/01). Statutory license requirements include minimum own funds (capital) in Maltese Liri or an equivalent amount in foreign currency, acceptable to the competent authority or established by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional requirements include adhering to the 'four eyes principle,' meeting fit and proper criteria, and fulfilling close links criteria. The license application should be processed within three months, with a possible extension of up to three months for additional information, but not exceeding six months in total.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Act outlines specific circumstances under which the competent authority could restrict, modify, or revoke a license, as well as instances where a license automatically becomes ineffective. The Act also provides procedures to be followed when the revocation of a license affects foreign regulators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regulatory and Investigatory Powers: The MFSA, as the competent authority under the Act, fulfills its supervisory responsibilities through its Banking Unit, both off-site and on-site. Off-site supervision involves the analysis of monthly and quarterly information filed by financial institutions, which is monitored for trends. On-site supervision includes planned and ad hoc visits to financial institutions, covering aspects like asset quality, capital adequacy, internal controls, and risk management.

    <h1>Netherlands Financial Service Providers</h1>
    <p>
      A financial service provider in the Netherlands offers financial products, provides advice, offers mediation services, reinsurance mediation services, or acts as an authorized agent in respect of financial products. The Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) exercises conduct of business supervision over financial service providers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banks and other financial companies in the Netherlands are regulated under the Financial Supervision Act, as well as related EU Directives. Various types of financial companies can be established under the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, including investment funds, asset and fund management companies, insurance companies, and dealers and brokerage companies. Each type of Dutch financial company is subject to specific licensing requirements based on the services we provide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dutch AFM and De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) issue licenses for a range of financial activities, including providing advice on financial products, services related to collective investment schemes, management services for alternative investment companies, offering credits and loans, investment services, insurance services, and clearing activities in the form of audit companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening a Dutch financial company involves several steps, including registering the company with the Dutch Companies Register and submitting an application with a business plan to the DNB or the AFM. Once the business plan is approved, you must prepare and submit various documents, including a Declaration of No Objection, an application for a specific activity license, an application for authorization to operate in Holland, and an application for authorization to act as a payment institution if applicable. Upon receiving the license, the company is entered into the register of licensed financial institutions in the Netherlands.

    <h1>Netherlands Investment Firms</h1>
    <p>
      The AFM is the licensing body for investment firms as referred to in the Financial Supervision [Wet financieel toezicht] Wft. To offer investment services in the Netherlands, registration is required. Investment firms must meet certain conditions, including the suitability and reliability of key personnel, ethical business conduct, and measures to protect clients' rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Investment firms with Our registered office in countries other than Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland need to obtain a license in the Netherlands. An investment firm provides investment services or performs investment activities, such as receiving and transmitting orders, executing orders, advising on financial instruments, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Setting up an investment firm in the Netherlands involves a detailed application process, including fitness and probity tests for board members and supervisory board members. The AFM charges an application fee, and the process typically takes around 6-9 months. The standard corporate income tax rate on income is 20% (for profits up to €200,000) / 25% (for profits in excess of €200,000).
    </p>
    <p>
      Benefits of establishing an investment firm in the Netherlands include no material super-equivalent requirements, broad domestic and treaty dividend withholding tax exemptions, limited quantitative requirements on corporate governance, and data protection legislation similar to the UK.

    <h1>Latvia Innovation and Fintech</h1>
    <p>
      FinTech is technology-based financial innovation that enables the development of a new business model or a way of applying it, a new process or service that changes the former approach. It should focus on promoting competition, providing a better quality, more efficient, faster and modern service to the Latvian customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the strategic directions of the FCMC is FinTech support, as well as promoting innovation in the financial system. In cooperation with other public institutions, the intention of the FCMC is to create a friendly environment for FinTech, which would promote innovative financial services in Latvia and attract new companies to provide these services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regulatory sandbox provides for a process enabling the existing or potential financial market participants, whose activities require operating authorization from the FCMC (license or registration), to test or verify innovative financial products, financial services or business models in accordance with a specific testing plan agreed with the FCMC. Regulatory sandbox is open to innovative financial solutions that would contribute positively to the sound functioning and development of the financial market, as well as improve and safely expand the options to use financial services for consumers and investors.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are currently two innovations in Latvia’s financial and capital market: one of them results from the market regulatory framework (second payment service directive, present strong customer authentication, near-field communication (NFC), application programming interface (API)), while the other one is based on the own initiative of financial and capital market participants (artificial intelligence, biometric data, robo-advisor, machine learning etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Latvia is one of the most popular fintech destinations and startup-friendly countries in the world by Index Ventures. Latvia-based fintechs are not limited geographically and establish companies worldwide in Switzerland, Africa, UK, Asia in lending, payment, asset management areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low costs, access to local banking infrastructure, fundraising and getting an FCMC payment (PI, EMI) license to operate throughout Europe are some of the benefits offered to Latvia-based companies. Besides licensing, the Latvia-based fintech ecosystem provides other significant elements. First, anyone may get a StartUp visa in one month and enjoy the easy reallocation procedure developed by the Latvia-based Investment and Development Agency. Secondly, Latvia has an attractive tax regime for startups: when reinvesting the profit, the income tax rate is ‘0’. Thirdly, the Latvia-based startup ecosystem is improved by stock options regulation, now fintechs can give away Our shares to employees to attract skilled tech talents.

    </p>
    <p>
      Due diligence legislation serves to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Its scope extends on the one hand to all licensed financial intermediaries such as banks, asset managers, or insurers, and persons subject to no licensing requirement under financial market legislation such as real estate brokers or traders in goods.
    </p>
    <h2>TVTG</h2>
    <p>
      With the creation of the TVTG, the registration and ad-hoc supervision of ten new categories of service providers which provide Our services on TT systems (e.g., blockchain) will be delegated to the FMA. The law also implements the FATF recommendations, which provide for supervision under the Due Diligence Act (DDA) for such services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursuant to Article 12(1) TVTG, legal and natural persons with headquarters (registered office) or place of residence in Liechtenstein who wish to professionally act as TT Service Providers must apply to be entered into the TT Service Provider Register (hereinafter "registration") in writing with the FMA before beginning Our activity.

    </p>
    <h2>Registration of a virtual asset service provider (VASP)</h2>

      No persons established in Luxembourg or providing services in Luxembourg may provide virtual asset services without being registered with the CSSF as provided for in Article 7-1(1) of the Law of 12 November 2004 on the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing (“AML/CFT Law”).
    </p>

      The requirement of registration for applicants, who are established or provide services in Luxembourg, is without prejudice to any other license/registration or other status required either in Luxembourg or by other European or third countries for any other activities performed by the applicant.
    </p>
    <h2>Initial Contact</h2>
    <p>
      The registration procedure generally starts with a meeting at the CSSF premises aiming to present the applicant and its project. Depending on the activities of the project, registration as a VASP may be necessary.
    </p>
    <h2>Finalization and Completion of Registration Procedure</h2>
    <p>
      When the CSSF has finished its analysis and a formal registration decision has been taken by the CSSF, the CSSF will complete the registration itself. After the registration has been completed, the registered entity is published in the national public register maintained by the CSSF. The fact that a VASP is entered in the register of the CSSF shall not, under any circumstance, be described in any way whatsoever as a positive assessment made by the CSSF of the quality of the services provided by the VASP. The registration, the submission of a registration and/or the CSSF AML/CFT supervision may not be invoked or used for advertising or possible solicitations for business.

    <h1>Switzerland Fintech</h1>
    <p>
      Fintech is a portmanteau of the terms “finance” and “technology” and refers to any business that uses technology to enhance or automate financial services and processes. The term encompasses a rapidly growing industry that serves the interests of both consumers and businesses in multiple ways. From mobile banking and insurance to cryptocurrency and investment apps, fintech has a seemingly endless array of applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fintech companies integrate technologies (like AI, blockchain, and data science) into traditional financial sectors to make them safer, faster, and more efficient. Fintech is one of the fastest-growing tech sectors, with companies innovating in almost every area of finance; from payments and loans to credit scoring and stock trading.
    </p>
    <h2>Fintech License in Switzerland</h2>
    <p>
      The FinTech license allows institutions to accept public deposits of up to CHF 100 million, provided that these are not invested and no interest is paid on them. A further requirement is that an institution with a FinTech license (persons under Article 1b of the Banking Act) must be a company limited by shares, a corporation with unlimited partners, or a limited liability company and must have its registered office and conduct its business activities in Switzerland.
    </p>
    <p>
      FINMA is responsible for granting the FinTech license. Upon receiving license applications, FINMA assesses whether the intended business activities require a license and whether the planned business activities are possible under the terms of the FinTech license.
    </p>
    <p>
      After receiving the application, FINMA will inform the applicant which FINMA staff member is responsible for Our licensing procedure and whether any additional information or documents need to be submitted. FINMA can request a licensing audit report from the applicant as part of the licensing procedure. It will decide on an individual basis whether this is necessary. The duration of the licensing procedure depends on the complexity of the project and the quality and completeness of the application.
    </p>
    <h3>Requirements for a fintech license</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Public deposits; Max. CHF 100 million</li>
      <li>Use of deposits; Deposit business only (no interest margin business)</li>
      <li>Minimum capital; CHF 300,000 or 3% of deposits</li>
      <li>Capital and liquidity requirements; None</li>
      <li>Supervision and monitoring; Reduced requirements on auditor; reduced audit frequency by request</li>
      <li>Accounting; As per Swiss Code of Obligations</li>
      <li>Deposit guarantee; None</li>
      <li>Organizational requirements; Exceptional relaxation of requirements possible</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Costs of a Fintech License</h2>
    <p>
      FINMA is responsible for granting fintech licenses and for the prudential supervision of fintech companies. Just like the banking license, the fintech license entails certain costs which are covered by fees and supervisory levies. FINMA has created a new section in its Fees and Levies Ordinance for levies on companies with a fintech license. This governs supervisory levies in line with the ‘user pays’ principle. The supervisory levy consists of a fixed basic levy of CHF 3,000 plus an additional levy, 20% of which is calculated based on the balance sheet total and 80% of which is calculated based on gross income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other costs may include;
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Founding costs, particularly for advice and notary services</li>
      <li>Advisory costs for policies and documents required by regulation, directives, etc.</li>
      <li>Costs of capital to meet the regulatory capital requirement</li>
      <li>Auditor and initial audit report costs</li>
      <li>Infrastructure costs, particularly office and IT costs</li>

    <h1>Insurance Companies and Intermediaries in the Czech Republic</h1>
    <p>
      The laws and regulations in the insurance area apply to domestic insurance companies and domestic reinsurance companies under the Insurance Act and insurance intermediaries and independent loss adjusters under the Act on Insurance Intermediaries and Independent Loss Adjusters. Branches of foreign insurance and reinsurance companies from non-EEA countries are also regulated in respect of activities carried on within the Czech Republic. Branches of foreign insurance companies from EEA countries are subject to regulation of and supervision by the country in which Our head offices are located.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, insurance activity in the Czech Republic can be undertaken by:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>an insurer with a Czech insurance license granted by the Czech Insurance Market Regulator, the Czech National Bank (the “CNB”);</li>
      <li>an insurer based in another EU or EEA member state which has established a branch in the Czech Republic;</li>
      <li>an insurer based outside the EU or EEA which has established a branch in the Czech Republic and has obtained a Czech insurance license; and</li>
      <li>an insurer based in the EU or EEA that has undertaken insurance business in the Czech Republic on a temporary basis.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The CNB (as the Czech Insurance Market Regulator) can grant a Czech insurance license to a joint-stock company, a cooperative established under Czech law, or a Czech branch of the insurance company based outside the EU or EEA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurers based in EU and EEA member states can operate in the Czech Republic through a branch established in the Czech Republic. We do not need to obtain a special license from the CNB to establish a branch. However, we must fulfill information obligations with respect to the Insurance Market Regulator in Our home member state before undertaking insurance activities in the Czech Republic. It is less expensive for an insurer from the EU or EEA to establish a branch office in the Czech Republic, rather than obtaining a license from the CNB. Insurers from countries outside the EU and the EEA can also establish a branch in the Czech Republic but this is usually rather lengthy and costly as it involves obtaining a special license from the CNB.

      A credit intermediary is a person who meets the conditions set out in the Creditors and Credit Intermediaries Act. The credit intermediary facilitates the issuing of credit to consumers for a fee or enables consumers to sign credit agreements. The credit intermediary assists consumers before we sign a credit agreement or when we are signing it, and intermediates contracts on behalf of the creditor independently and permanently or signs them on behalf of and on the account of the creditor. A mortgage intermediary mediates mortgage-backed credit to consumers.
    </p>

    <h1>Estonia Insurance Intermediaries</h1>
    <p>
      An insurance intermediary specializes in intermediating insurance contracts and earns a fee for doing so. Insurance intermediaries in Estonia are divided into insurance brokers and insurance agents. The roles of an insurance broker and an insurance agent are fundamentally different, as an insurance broker represents the interests of the policyholder, while the agent represents the interests of the insurance company.
    </p>
    <h2>Registration of Insurance Intermediaries</h2>
    <p>
      Insurance agents are listed under the insurance company that authorized Our activity. The insurance company is responsible for the correctness of the entries in the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an insurance broker to be entered in the list of insurance intermediaries, an application must be submitted in writing to Finantsinspektsioon. The decision of whether to accept the entry in the list or to refuse it is taken by Finantsinspektsioon within one month after the documents and data required by law have been submitted.
    </p>
    <h3>Registration of Insurance Agents in the List of Insurance Intermediaries</h3>
    <p>
      Insurance agents are entered into the list of intermediaries by the insurance company we represent or by Finantsinspektsioon in certain circumstances defined by law. The insurer enters the insurance agent into the list of intermediaries immediately after signing a contract with the agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name, personal ID code or date of birth if we have no ID code, and contact details of an insurance agent who is a physical person are entered in the list of intermediaries. Before signing the agent contract, the insurance agent must inform the insurer of any significant participation in another insurer, if we directly or indirectly hold 10% or more of the shares or equity of the insurer or its parent company or control the votes of 10% or more of the shares or have other rights that would allow them to influence the management of that company.
    </p>
    <h3>Registration of Insurance Brokers in the List of Insurance Intermediaries</h3>
    <p>
      In order to be entered in the list of intermediaries, an insurance broker shall submit to the Financial Supervision Authority a written application and all the information and documents required. An applicant shall promptly notify the Financial Supervision Authority of any changes in the information and documents specified in subsection 187 (1) of the Insurance Activities Act when becoming aware of the fact that caused the change or after changing the information and documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Financial Supervision Authority shall make a decision to enter or refuse to enter an insurance broker in the list of intermediaries within three months after the submission of all the required data and documents. The business name, registry code, address of the registered office, contact details, including an e-mail address and website address, if any, and the name of the member of the management board responsible for insurance distribution shall be entered in the list of intermediaries with regard to an applicant which is a company.
    </p>
    <h2>Providing Cross-Border Insurance Intermediation Services in Estonia</h2>

    <h1>Insurance and Reinsurance Intermediary in Gibraltar</h1>
    <p>
      Insurance and Reinsurance Mediation refers to any activity involving the advising on, proposing or undertaking of preparatory work for entering into insurance contracts, including administration and performance of insurance contracts. Insurance intermediaries are brokers or agents who represent consumers in insurance transactions. Two types of regulated activity you can apply for:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>General/Non-Life Business.</li>
      <li>Life Business.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Applicants should submit an application form and additional documentation with all relevant documents. An Insurance or Reinsurance Intermediary is required to hold an initial and ongoing capital of:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>€19,510; or</li>
      <li>4% of the sum of annual premiums received or as projected at application, whichever is the greater.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Subject to the above, the GFSC expects firms to hold a minimum level of financial resources equivalent to 3 months’ worth of operating expenses (or as projected at application).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are prescribed minimum requirements established under the Act regarding the premises, capital, solvency, management, staff, and resources that have to be attained to be licensed. Insurance and Reinsurance Intermediaries are required to have on a permanent basis:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Professional Indemnity Insurance covering the whole territory of the Union, guaranteeing against liability arising from professional negligence, for at least €1,300,380 (or sterling equivalent) applying to each claim and in aggregate €1,924,560 (or sterling equivalent) per year for all claims.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensuring that money paid by the policyholder to the Intermediary is treated as having already been paid to the Insurance Company, whereas money paid by the Insurance Company to the Intermediary is not treated as having been paid to the policyholder until the customer actually receives it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensuring that policyholders’ money is only transferred via strictly segregated client accounts and that these accounts shall not be used to reimburse other creditors in the event of bankruptcy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensuring we have adequate mechanisms for receiving and dealing with Complaints.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Life Insurance and Life Reinsurance Intermediaries must comply with the GFSC’s Anti-money laundering Guidance Notes.

    <p>
      Insurers in Guernsey can be licensed to write either general business (i.e. non-life) or long-term business (i.e. life). New composite insurers are no longer allowed except where the life/non-life insurance business is incidental in terms of premium income to the principal non-life/life insurance business being written by the licensed insurer, or where the licensed insurer is a protected cell or incorporated cell company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurers licensed in Guernsey can be international insurers, which underwrite non-local insurance risks, or domestic insurers, which underwrite wholly, or primarily, Bailiwick of Guernsey insurance risks. International insurers can be classified into two types as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Pure captive insurer – an insurer established for the sole purpose of insuring some or all of the risks of its parent</li>
      <li>Commercial insurer – an insurer established for the primary purpose of participating in the traditional insurance or reinsurance market</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The majority of the international insurers licensed in Guernsey are administered by licensed insurance managers who act as a general representative to and manage the day-to-day operations of, these licensed insurers.
    </p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Corporate vehicle permitted are Guernsey company, Protected cell company (PCC), Incorporated cell company (ICC)</li>
      <li>Minimum paid-up capital GBP 100,000</li>

      <li>Corporate directorship allowed</li>
      <li>Minimum number of shareholders is two</li>
      <li>A company secretary is required</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tax Treatment</h2>
    <p>
      There is no capital, value-added, or inheritance taxes in Guernsey, nor any stamp or document duties except in respect of Guernsey real property. With the exception of certain businesses, companies (including funds) now pay a standard rate of 0% income tax on profits. Funds still have the option to apply for exempt company status (on payment of an annual fee of £600).

    <h1>Isle of Man Insurance Protected Cell Companies/Incorporated Cell Companies</h1>
    <p>
      The Protected Cell Companies Act 2004 and the Insurance (Protected Cell Companies) Regulations 2004 provide a framework for the operation of Protected Cell Companies on the Island. The Regulations provide for the establishment of new protected cell insurance companies, and also for the conversion of existing insurance companies into protected cell companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A protected cell company, or PCC, can be thought of as being a standard limited company that has been separated into legally distinct portions or cells. The revenue streams, assets, and liabilities of each cell are kept separate from all other cells. Each cell has its own separate portion of the PCC's overall share capital, allowing shareholders to maintain sole ownership of an entire cell while owning only a small proportion of the PCC as a whole. PCCs can provide a means of entry into the captive insurance market to entities for which it was previously uneconomic. The overheads of a protected cell captive can be shared between the owners of each of the cells, making the captive cheaper to run from the point of view of the insured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Incorporated Cell Companies Act 2010, Incorporated Cells Regulations 2011, and Insurance (Incorporated Cell Companies) Regulations 2011 provide a framework for the operation of incorporated cell companies on the Island and set out the requirements that must be observed by incorporated cell companies carrying on, or wishing to carry on, insurance business.
    </p>
    <p>
      An incorporated cell company, or ICC, is based on the same principles as a PCC. It is a company that has the power to establish incorporated cells as part of its corporate structure, but in an ICC, each incorporated cell is a separate legal entity.

      The Isle of Man Financial Services Authority (“the Authority”) is responsible, under the Insurance Act 2008, for the authorization of insurance businesses on the Isle of Man. Applications for authorization are made in writing by the applicant to the Authority. As part of this authorization process, the Authority seeks to ensure that new entrants to the insurance sector meet the required minimum standards expected of an Isle of Man regulated entity, thereby protecting the reputation of the Island as a reputable and responsible financial center.
    </p>
    <h2>Authorisation Procedure</h2>
    <p>
      Prospective applicants are encouraged to contact officers of the Isle of Man Financial Services Authority (“the Authority”) at an early stage to discuss Our proposals for establishing and operating a regulated business in the Isle of Man. These discussions enable the Authority’s officers to give applicants any appropriate guidance where it is sought and to identify any foreseeable difficulties connected with the proposed operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Protected Cell Companies (“PCCs”)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      On receipt of the application, the staff of the Authority will process the application. This will include a review of the application form and supporting documents, and, if appropriate, discussion with other regulatory bodies. In addition, the Authority considers whether the proposed holders of certain roles are fit and proper. On completion of these inquiries, the staff will make a recommendation as to whether an authorization should be granted and detailing any conditions that it may be appropriate to attach to the authorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Incorporated Cell Companies (“ICC”)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Persons intending to form an ICC, or an incorporated cell of an ICC (an “IC”), may apply to the Authority for provisional authorization for the ICC or IC. A provisional authorization does not of itself authorize the ICC or IC, when formed, to carry on insurance business but does indicate that the ICC or IC will become authorized when formed. The processing of a provisional authorization or an authorization for an ICC or IC would follow the same route as outlined above.

    <h1>Liechtenstein Insurance Intermediaries</h1>
    <p>
      As part of insurance intermediary supervision, the FMA is responsible for execution of the Insurance Distribution Act and the associated Insurance Distribution Ordinance. The FMA carries out the following main tasks in particular:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Issuing and withdrawal of licenses for insurance intermediaries</li>
      <li>Maintenance of an insurance intermediary register</li>
      <li>Ongoing supervision of insurance intermediaries</li>
      <li>Safeguarding of the interests of policyholders, especially by receiving Our complaints</li>
      <li>Ordering of measures to prevent or remedy grievances</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The FMA supervises all activities of Liechtenstein insurance intermediaries and, in this context, also ensures proper supervision of the cross-border activities of Liechtenstein insurance intermediaries in the EEA and Switzerland.
    </p>
    <h2>Licensing Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      Intermediaries domiciled in Liechtenstein require a license from the FMA to take up insurance distribution. No license is required for intermediaries who are already supervised in another Contracting Party to the European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement or Switzerland and are active in Liechtenstein under the freedom to provide services or freedom of establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The license application and the documents to be submitted with it must be in German or English. The application must be completed online and subsequently submitted to the FMA. With regard to the submission, it may be submitted in writing by post or in electronic form to the FMA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intermediaries that are legal persons must have Our registered office in Liechtenstein. The head office of an intermediary must be situated in Liechtenstein and is defined not only by the registered office of the intermediary but also by the center of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as all the information and documents necessary for assessing the license application are available, the FMA confirms to the applicant in writing that the application is complete. The FMA decides whether to grant a license within three months of receipt of the complete application and informs the applicant without delay of the decision. All licensed intermediaries are entered in the intermediary register to be maintained ex officio by the FMA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fee for the grant of the license and for entry in the register is as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Legal persons: 4,000 Swiss francs plus 200 Swiss francs per employee who works in insurance distribution</li>
      <li>Natural persons: 2,000 Swiss francs plus 200 Swiss francs per employee who works in insurance distribution. Sole proprietorships are treated as natural persons with regard to fees</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In addition, the FMA collects an annual supervisory tax from the intermediaries. This consists of a fixed basic tax and a variable supplemental tax and is limited to an annual maximum of 6,500 Swiss francs. The basic tax per year for intermediaries is:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>For legal persons: 2,500 Swiss francs</li>
      <li>For natural persons/sole proprietorship: 1,250 Swiss francs</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The supplemental tax for intermediaries amounts to 0.25% of gross income. The gross income of the year preceding the year of taxation shall be decisive.

      The MFSA is responsible for the authorizations and subsequent supervision of authorized insurance and reinsurance undertakings effecting and carrying out business of insurance (hereinafter referred to as “undertakings”), insurance agents, insurance brokers, insurance managers, tied insurance intermediaries and ancillary insurance intermediaries, (hereinafter referred to as “insurance intermediaries”).
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurance Intermediaries are required to comply with the Insurance Distribution Act, regulations issued thereunder, and the Insurance Distribution Rules and Conduct of Business Rules issued by the MFSA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carrying on of Malta insurance business is governed by two complementary laws, namely, the Insurance Business Act and the Insurance Intermediaries Act. The possibility of carrying on, in or from Malta business of insurance is dependent on the requisite authorization being obtained from the MFSA which is the competent regulatory and supervisory authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maltese insurance business legislation transposes European Union Insurance Directives which regulate the taking-up and pursuit of direct insurance, reinsurance and the carrying out of insurance intermediaries’ activities. Malta’s E.U. membership enables insurance companies licensed in Malta to benefit from EU passporting rights, that is, by virtue of a simple system of notification of the home country regulator to the host country regulator, a Malta based insurance company may write directly into other EU/EEA markets without the need to apply for another additional license in the host Member State.
    </p>
    <h2>Authorization and Licensing of Intermediaries</h2>
    <p>
      The Insurance Intermediaries Act allows insurance intermediaries to be established as companies. Alternatively, individuals can apply for enrollment into the brokers', managers', or agents' list maintained by the MFSA. Local companies must satisfy the following requirements:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The objects must be limited to operations arising directly from insurance intermediary activities, as applicable, to the exclusion of all other commercial business, unless otherwise determined.</li>
      <li>The intermediary must disclose information requested by the MFSA in relation to persons who will have any proprietary, financial or other interest in, or connection with it.</li>
      <li>All qualifying shareholders, directors, controllers and all persons who will effectively direct or manage the affairs or carry out the operations appropriate to the application must be fit and proper persons to ensure its sound and prudent management.</li>
      <li>The intermediary's own funds are at all times not less than the amount appropriate for the kind of business to be carried on by it.</li>
      <li>The intermediary has at all times in its favor a policy of professional indemnity insurance or some other comparable guarantee indemnifying it or any person employed by it or otherwise acting for it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For a foreign company, additional information must be provided relating to registration or permission to carry on insurance intermediary activities where its head office is situated. The undertaking must establish a branch in Malta and have a representative at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
      A local company applying for a license as an insurance intermediary must register one or more of the company's directors and a person carrying out the insurance intermediaries' activities in the agents', managers', or brokers' register maintained by the MFSA.

    </p>
    <h2>Formation of an insurance undertaking</h2>
    <p>
      Undertakings that operate direct insurance or reinsurance in Liechtenstein or from Liechtenstein (insurance undertakings) and special purpose vehicles are subject to insurance supervision. insurance undertakings that operate direct insurance or reinsurance in the form of captives are also subject to insurance supervision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurance undertakings subject to supervision require a license from the supervisory authority to take up business. The license application and the documents to be submitted must in principle be in German. The FMA may allow exceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minimum capital requirement may not be lower than the following amounts:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>EUR 2,500,000 or the equivalent in Swiss francs for non-life insurance undertakings, including captive direct insurance undertakings;</li>

      Insurance and reinsurance activities are mainly regulated in the Act on Financial Supervision (Wet op het financieel toezicht) (AFS) and its rules, such as the Decree Prudential Rules (Besluit prudentiële regels Wft) and the Decree on Market Conduct Supervision (Besluit Gedragstoezicht financiële ondernemingen Wft). The AFS contains the licensing requirements for insurers and reinsurers, as well as the prudential and conduct of business requirements that apply to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurers are supervised by the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank) and the Dutch Authority for Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financiële Markten) (AFM). The Dutch Central Bank is responsible for both issuing licenses to insurers and supervising ongoing compliance with the prudential requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      An insurer with its registered office in The Netherlands can take any of the following legal forms:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Public limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap) (NV).</li>
      <li>Mutual insurance society (onderlinge waarborgmaatschappij).</li>
      <li>European public limited liability company (Societas Europaea) (SE).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Most insurers in The Netherlands are organized as an NV or as a mutual insurance society. The NV and SE are both public companies with limited liability with a capital divided into shares, and generally have a profit motive. An SE must have operations in at least two member states of the European Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like any other company offering financial services, an insurance company must also register with the Financial Supervisory Authority in the Netherlands (DNB) which keeps a register of insurers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following services can be provided by companies operating in the insurance sector in the Netherlands:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>life insurance services;</li>
      <li>non-life insurance services;</li>
      <li>funeral insurance services.</li>

      Foreign insurance and reinsurance companies are also allowed to offer Our services in the Netherlands through branch offices which have obtained a specific license issued by the Dutch National Bank.
    </p>
    <h2>Licenses for insurance and reinsurance companies in the Netherlands</h2>
    <p>
      The National Bank is the main authority issuing the licenses related to offering any type of insurance or reinsurance services in the Netherlands. In order to set up a company in the Dutch insurance sector, one must apply for these licenses which are issued after the company submits several documents, including a sound business plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurance and reinsurance companies in the Netherlands are also required to meet certain criteria related to the directors and employees who must obtain various qualifications. The minimum share capital an insurance company must deposit is 1.2 million euros, while the maximum amount is 3.7 million euros. The capital depends on the services the insurance company provides.

      Insurance intermediaries serve as the critical link between insurance companies seeking to place insurance policies and consumers seeking to procure insurance coverage. Intermediaries, traditionally called “brokers” or “agents” or “producers,” offer advice, information, and other services in connection with the solicitation, negotiation, and sale of insurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurance and reinsurance intermediaries must be authorized by the FCA. Insurance intermediaries must apply to the FCA for permission to carry out such activities as arranging deals in insurance contracts, dealing in insurance contracts as agents, and assisting in the administration and performance of an insurance contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar application process to that described for insurance companies applies in the case of insurance intermediaries, and the relevant forms to be submitted to the FCA on behalf of the insurance intermediary can be found on the FCA website. The application fee is:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>GBP 1,500 (approximately USD 1,900) for a straightforward application.</li>

    <h1>United Kingdom General Insurers</h1>
    <p>
      General insurance is non-life insurance cover for damage or loss. It includes products such as motor, travel, pet, health, and home insurance. In 2013, the government implemented wide-ranging reforms to the way the financial services sector – including insurance – is regulated. The body which regulated the UK financial services industry, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), was replaced by two new regulatory bodies. This is known as the ‘twin peaks’ system of regulation:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA), which is part of the Bank of England, promotes the safety and soundness of insurers, and the protection of policyholders.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulates how these firms behave, as well as more broadly the integrity of the UK’s financial markets.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Licensing of insurance</h2>
    <p>
      A firm intending to effect or carry out insurance or reinsurance contracts in the UK must obtain the relevant Part 4A FSMA permission from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), unless it is exempt or able to rely on the EU's passporting regime (however, this is likely to change following the impending end of the transition period of the UK's departure from the EU). To obtain a Part 4A FSMA permission, an applicant must satisfy the "threshold conditions" both on authorization and on an ongoing basis. The "threshold conditions" include satisfying the regulator that the applicant:
    </p>

    <h1>Czech Republic Trademark Registration</h1>
    <p>
      In the Czech Republic, trademark registration is mandatory to be granted rights over a trademark, as it is a "first to file" jurisdiction. Only in some exceptional cases can an unregistered trademark be protected. The trademark applications must be filed with the Industrial Property Office of the Czech Republic (UPV).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Czech Republic is also a member of the European Union, therefore trademark protection can also be obtained by registering a European Union Trademarks (EUTM), and a member state to the Madrid Protocol, which means that the extension of an international registration of a trademark via the Madrid System is possible for this country.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in the Czech Republic, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Registered trademarks in the Czech Republic have an initial validity of ten (10) years from the application date and can then be renewed indefinitely for successive periods of ten years. The trademark renewal can be requested as early as twelve (12) months before the expiration date, or during the grace period of six (6) months that follows it upon payment of late renewal fees. Multiple-class trademark applications are possible in the Czech Republic.
    </p>
    <h2>Minimum filing requirements in the Czech Republic</h2>
    <p>
      The minimum filing requirements for a trademark application in the Czech Republic are the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Request to register the trademark in the Czech Republic, signed by the applicant.</li>
      <li>List of goods and/or services according to the International Classification.</li>
      <li>Representation of the trademark.</li>
      <li>Filing fee (may be paid within one month from filing).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In the Czech Republic, a trademark can be registered in three ways:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>According to national procedure.</li>
      <li>According to regional procedure - an application is submitted for a single EU trademark.</li>
      <li>According to international procedure.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The most popular and effective one is the national procedure for registration of trademark in the Czech Republic. Any legal or natural person has the right to apply to the Industrial Property Office (IPO) for trademark registration. Two-stage examination of trademark is conducted, namely:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Formal verification of the compliance of the application with the requirements of the law.</li>
      <li>Substantive examination.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In accordance with the Law on trademarks adopted in 2003, trademark in the Czech Republic may include any designations represented in graphical form, namely: words (including personal names), letters, holograms, pictures, colors, figures, the image of the product or its packaging. Even sounds can designate trademark, but only those represented graphically in the form of notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, the application is published in the weekly edition of the Official Gazette of the Office. It should be noted that the period from the submission of the application to its publication can take from one week to one year. From the moment of publication, third parties have the right to file Our objections within three months.
    </p>
    <p>
      If no objections have been filed during this time, information on the trademark is entered by the Office into the Register. The whole procedure for registering trademark in the Czech Republic usually takes 9-12 months.
    </p>
    <h2>Trademark Fees in the Czech Republic</h2>
    <p>
      Search prices: First class $100.00 - Each additional class $80.00. The price is for wordmarks only. If the trademark includes a figurative element (logo), an additional fee of 30 USD per class will apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Application prices: First class $640.00 - Each additional class $140.00. The price for the "First Class" includes 3 classes. The price for "additional class" applies starting with the 4th class.

      Trust management, particularly for wealthy UK individuals, has been a traditional business for Gibraltar.

    </p>

      The basic law of trusts is contained in the Gibraltar Trustee Ordinance, which is virtually a copy of English trust legislation. Gibraltarian legislation affecting trusts also includes the Perpetuities and Accumulations Ordinance, the Trustee Investments Ordinance, the Bankruptcy Ordinance, the Trusts (Recognition) Ordinance, and the Financial Services (Conduct of Fiduciary Services Business) Regulations 2006.

    <h1>Liechtenstein International Trust</h1>
    <p>
      The total revision of the Professional Trustees Act created a comprehensive, efficient and internationally recognized supervision of the trust business. Consequently, it is possible to combat abuse even more efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone intending to offer services under the Trustees Act in the Principality of Liechtenstein requires an FMA license as a professional trustee or trust company. The FMA monitors compliance with this licensing requirement and authorized use of the term “professional trustee” or equivalent professional or business term. It follows up on all indications of non-licensed trustee activities or the use of protected terms by non-licensed persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creation of trusts became possible for the first time within the territory of continental Europe in Liechtenstein in 1926 with the adoption of the Anglo-Saxon trust institution at the legislative level. From 1926 until nowadays, the activities of trusts in Europe are recognized only in Liechtenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      A trust established in Liechtenstein can have both commercial and non-commercial goals, while compulsory observing the legitimacy of these goals, and we should not contradict the principles of morality. Basically, trusts are established to generate income when managing family assets and guarantee Our long-term protection.
    </p>
    <h2>Procedure for Registering a Trust</h2>
    <p>
      According to Liechtenstein's trust laws, the establishment of a trust occurs by entering into a written declaration of trust between the founder on the one part and one or more trust managers on the other. It is also possible to formally establish a trust by drawing up a unilateral trust declaration and consent to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The declaration of trust can be executed in any language with clearly defined clauses regarding the conditions of this trust relative to the beneficial owners, the nature of the trust property, the conditions for the distribution of income between the beneficial owners and the final separation of the property of the trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      All trusts which existence is planned for more than one year must be registered in the Commercial Register no later than 12 months from the date of Our establishment. For this purpose, an official document is provided to the Register, indicating the name of the trust, the date of its establishment, the period for which it was established, and a complete list of trust managers and Our addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      When registering a declaration of trust in Liechtenstein, you must pay a one-time registration fee of CHF 200.
    </p>
    <p>
      Declaration of trust and all data on the trust are not publicly available, which allows us to give evidence of confidentiality. At the same time, all changes in the data of the trust must be registered in the Register.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amount of the minimum capital to create a trust is not specified anywhere, and can, for example, amount to one thousand Swiss francs.
    </p>
    <h2>Features & Structure of Trusts</h2>
    <p>
      The person who establishes the trust and contributes the constituent capital is called the founder of the trust. The founder can be represented both by a natural person and a legal entity. Under the laws of Liechtenstein, the founders of trusts in this country cannot manage and control the trust, but have only those rights that are stipulated in the declaration of trust at its establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trust manager or trustee is in charge of managing the trust. Under the laws of Liechtenstein, the property of the trustee must be kept separately from the property of the trust, and in this case the beneficial owners will be able to claim his ownership if the assets entrusted to the trustee are lost by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Trust can appoint an auditor that is a person who monitors compliance with the declaration of trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The founder of the trust determines the beneficial owners, who may be natural or legal persons. The beneficial owners cannot manage the trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Submission of reports on the activities of trusts in the tax authorities is not required. In Liechtenstein, the minimum tax for the income of trust is 1200 Swiss francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trust can be liquidated at any time. The law does not provide for the timing of the liquidation of the trust.

      The MFSA is responsible for the supervision of trustees and other fiduciaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overall aim of the Authority is to monitor the supervision of authorised trustees and other fiduciaries, including administrators of private foundations and Our level of compliance with the applicable legislative framework so as to ensure an appropriate degree of protection for the clients of persons carrying on such regulated activity. Trustees and other fiduciaries are deemed to be gatekeepers to the financial system in view of the fact that the structures which we set up may have wide-ranging effects and uses within the financial sector as a whole. In this respect the MFSA’s scrutiny of the trustee and fiduciary service providers is taken very seriously in view of the heightened risks which these sectors may pose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Authority adopts a risk-based approach with respect to the supervision of trustees and other fiduciaries. A risk monitoring system is utilised whereby the data collated through the offsite supervision and any other intelligence available is inputted and a risk score is allocated to each authorised trustee or fiduciary. This risk score will determine the type and frequency of supervision conducted by the Authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Authority adopts a mixture of tools with respect to supervision, with onsite inspections being the most frequently utilised method. This may take the form of either a comprehensive top-down review of all the systems and procedures of the authorised person, or a focused inspection on a specific area.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a common thing to find trusts incorporated in the law systems of civil law countries. Malta, however, is different in the fact that a civil law jurisdiction that does recognize the trust concept. In the Maltese trusts and trustees act, a trust may validly exist until the 125th anniversary of the date on which it came into existence, and, unless sooner terminated, would then terminate. This limitation (against perpetuities) would not, however, apply in respect of a trust created for charitable purposes or a unit trust or a qualifying retirement scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Components to Register a Trust in Malta</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The settlor is the person that creates the trust by providing and transferring assets, which will constitute the subject matter of the trust, to the trustee that has been appointed. Once the settlor determines who is to benefit from the trust the settlor is left without any rights in regards to the property in the trust. However, the Trusts and Trustees Act highlights the rights of a settlor, which are provided along with the trust deed.</li>
      <li>The trustee is the person who has been appointed by the settlor as the legal owner of the trust property. Trustees in Malta are licensed, regulated, and supervised by the MFSA. The legal obligation that binds a trustee means that he/she must deal with the trust property over which he/she exercises control for the exclusive benefit of the objects of the trust.</li>
      <li>The beneficiary is the person(s) who benefit from a trust. A beneficiary must be mentioned by name or ascertained by relationship or class to the settlor. Children of all ages, including conceived children, who are beneficiaries must be mentioned in the trust deed.</li>

    <p>
      A private trust company (PTC) is a privately owned corporate trustee that is often the vehicle of choice to act as a trustee of a trust or a number of trusts holding the assets of very wealthy families.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998, as amended, (the “Financial Services Law”) is the principal legislation which regulates Jersey’s trust company industry. Amongst other things, it requires any person who carries out trust company business as a business in the Island to be duly registered by the Jersey Financial Services Commission (the “Commission”) under the Financial Services Law. Acting as or fulfilling or arranging for another person to act as or fulfil the functions of a trustee of an express trust is a regulated activity under the Financial Services Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Private Trust Company Business Exemption</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The sole purpose of the PTC must be to provide trust company business services in respect of one or more trusts. If there are multiple trusts, it would be expected that we are all linked to the same family.</li>
      <li>As mentioned above, the PTC need not be a Jersey company. It may be incorporated in any other jurisdiction, in which case this exemption will only be relevant if the PTC operates in or from within Jersey.</li>
      <li>No specific provisions are required in the constitutional documents of the company. A suitable memorandum of association and articles of association can be supplied.</li>
      <li>The registration exemption applies only to the provision of trust company business services in respect of trusts. Services provided to companies are not covered by the exemption.</li>
      <li>There is no formal procedure for the securing of the exemption, and importantly, there is no public record of PTCs. The name of the PTC must, however, be notified to the JFSC.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Ownership of PTC
    </p>
    <p>
      The shares in a PTC can be owned in a number of different ways depending on tax considerations and the client’s circumstances.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Individual; this is whereby the client or members of the client’s family own the shares in the PTC in Our personal names. This is, however, unattractive to many clients as it may cause issues with taxation, confidentiality, and heirship.</li>
      <li>Purpose Trust; In view of the problems associated with ownership by an individual, a PTC is usually an ‘orphaned’ structure so that its ownership is not attributable to any particular person. The shares of a PTC are therefore often held under the terms of a charitable or non-charitable purpose trust (a “Trust”). Where there is doubt about whether a charitable purpose trust will be used for genuine charitable purposes, a non-charitable purpose trust is used to avoid allegations that the charitable trust is a sham. If a non-charitable purpose trust is used, the client would have the benefit of appointing an enforcer who is commonly a trusted professional family adviser.</li>
      <li>Foundation; A foundation can be established with the sole object of holding the shares in a PTC. A foundation is incorporated on the instruction of a founder but is not owned by the founder, nor by anyone else. Therefore, ownership issues will not arise in that context.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Features of a PTC
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Type of company used - Private, no limit on place of incorporation</li>
      <li>Licensing requirements - None</li>
      <li>Registration requirements - None</li>
      <li>Approval from JFSC - No, simply notify the name</li>
      <li>Public record of shareholders - Yes, but use of nominees is possible (if Jersey company)</li>
      <li>Public record of directors - No (if Jersey company)</li>
      <li>Annual filings - Yes, annual return and fee for the PTC</li>
      <li>External audit - No, unless constitutional documents specify</li>
      <li>Jersey taxation - 0% income tax and GST exemption available</li>
      <li>No. of directors - Minimum of one, if a Jersey company</li>
      <li>No. of shareholders - Minimum of one, if a Jersey company</li>
      <li>Jersey resident Directors required? - No</li>

    <h2>Belize Private Fund License</h2>
    <p>
        Mutual fund or “fund” means a company incorporated, a partnership formed, a unit trust
        organised or other similar body formed or organised under the laws of Belize or that of any
        other country or jurisdiction which,
        (a) Collects and pools funds for the purpose of collective investment; and
        (b) Issues shares (as herein defined) that entitle the holder to receive on demand or within a
        specified period after demand an amount computed by reference to the value of a
        proportionate interest in the whole or in a part of the net assets of the company, the
        partnership or the unit trust, as the case may be,
        And includes an umbrella fund whose shares are split into a number of different class funds or
        sub-funds, but excludes any arrangements which are designated by regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The conditions under which these funds are registered, administrated and managed from
        within Belize (or elsewhere) are expressly anchored in the Mutual Fund Act and provides for
        the basic protection of mutual fund investors. The Act does not impose specific requirements
        with regard to the location of the manager, investment advisor, administrator or the custodian
        of a public, private or professional fund. As is defined under the Mutual Fund Act, the
        expression of carrying on business from within Belize includes carrying on business outside of
        Belize from a place of business or from a registered office within Belize. For the purpose of
        carrying on business as a mutual fund, a manager or administrator, shall, if carrying on
        business anywhere outside of Belize, be deemed to be carrying on business from within Belize.
    </p>

    <h2>About Belize Private Fund</h2>
    <p>
        The Belize Mutual Funds Act defines a Private Fund as a fund that has less than fifty investors
        and the constitutional documents of which prohibit the offering of its shares to the general
        public. Certain private funds are designed primarily to provide capital growth while others are
        intended to preserve capital.
    </p>
    <p>
        At application, a proposed private fund will be expected to demonstrate the “private basis” of
        offering its shares to prospective investors and to explain what criteria will enable any
        particular investors to qualify as “private”. It remains with the Registrar of Mutual Funds to
        either accept or reject any such explanation.

    <h2>Belize Public Fund License</h2>
    <p>
        Mutual fund or “fund” means a company incorporated, a partnership formed, a unit trust
        organised or other similar body formed or organised under the laws of Belize or that of any
        other country or jurisdiction which,
        (a) Collects and pools funds for the purpose of collective investment; and
        (b) Issues shares (as herein defined) that entitle the holder to receive on demand or within a
        specified period after demand an amount computed by reference to the value of a
        proportionate interest in the whole or in a part of the net assets of the company, the
        partnership or the unit trust, as the case may be,
        And includes an umbrella fund whose shares are split into a number of different class funds or
        sub-funds, but excludes any arrangements which are designated by regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The conditions under which these funds are registered, administrated and managed from
        within Belize (or elsewhere) are expressly anchored in the Mutual Fund Act and provides for
        the basic protection of mutual fund investors. The Act does not impose specific requirements
        with regard to the location of the manager, investment advisor, administrator or the custodian
        of a public, private or professional fund. As is defined under the Mutual Fund Act, the
        expression of carrying on business from within Belize includes carrying on business outside of
        Belize from a place of business or from a registered office within Belize. For the purpose of
        carrying on business as a mutual fund, a manager or administrator, shall, if carrying on
        business anywhere outside of Belize, be deemed to be carrying on business from within Belize.
    </p>

    <h2>About Belize Public Fund</h2>
    <p>
        Public fund means a mutual fund which, offers any shares it issues for subscription or purchase
        to any member of the general public or any section thereof; and is not a private fund or a
        professional fund.
    </p>
    <p>
        Public Mutual Funds are allowed to conduct business only after its official prospectus has been
        inspected by the Registrar of Mutual Funds for official recognition and registration.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Public Mutual fund is widely considered to be one of the most important forms of
        investment available in a capital market and public offerings made for the purchase of its
        multiple share class subscriptions provide mutual fund investors with the potential for long-
        term capital appreciation and growth.

    <h2>Bermuda Private Fund License</h2>
    Investment Funds are pooled investment vehicles structured either as Mutual Fund Companies,
    Unit Trusts, Partnership Funds or Limited Liability Company “LLC” Funds.
    Bermuda Investment Funds Amendment Act 2019 sets forth the regulatory environment for
    operation of mutual funds in Bermuda. The Amendment Act brings within scope closed-ended
    investment funds and overseas investment funds. A person operating a closed-ended fund or
    an overseas investment fund prior to 1 January 2020 may continue to operate the fund without
    the fund being authorised, registered or designated under the Funds Act for a period of 6
    months. Operators of funds should use the transition period to assess whether the changes to
    the Funds Act are applicable to them. Open-ended investment funds are currently required to
    be classified as one of the Authorised Funds or Registered Funds under the Funds Act.
    An application for registration or authorisation must be submitted to the BMA in a prescribed
    form, which will require the submission of certain information and documentation relating to
    the fund and payment of a registration fee.
  </p>
  <p>
    A fund may apply for registration under the following classifications if it satisfies the relevant
    criteria (as set out below):
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Private Fund;</li>
    <li>Professional Closed Fund;</li>
    <li>Professional Class A Fund; or</li>
    <li>Professional Class B Fund</li>
  </ol>
  <p>(collectively referred to herein as “Registered Funds”).</p>
  <p>
    Registered Funds are generally subject to less extensive regulation than Authorised Funds.
  </p>
  <p><strong>About Private Fund</strong></p>
  <p>
    A fund may be registered as a Private Fund if the number of participants does not exceed 20
    persons and the fund does not promote itself by communicating an invitation or inducement to
    the public generally.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Private Fund must appoint a local service provider authorised and regulated by the BMA.
    The operator of an open-ended Private Fund is required to appoint a custodian with regard to
    ensuring safekeeping of the fund’s assets and a fund administrator. The operator of a closed-
    ended Private Fund is required to designate responsibility for segregating and safekeeping the
    investment fund property to a fit and proper person to act as such based on the nature of the
    investment fund property.

    <h2>About Standard Fund</h2>
    <p>
        A fund qualifies as a Standard fund if it does not fit within any other class of authorised fund.
        Such funds are not restricted to sophisticated investors and may include a more significant
        retail element among their investors. Consequently, they are subject to more comprehensive
        regulation and supervision.
    </p>
    <p>
        Typically for retail investors, a standard fund has no set minimum investment amount. A fund
        administrator is required to be based in Bermuda while other fund officers may be based
        anywhere in the world.

  <p><strong>BVI Approved Funds</strong></p>
  <p>The British Virgin Islands (BVI) is the second largest offshore jurisdiction for hedge funds globally and a prominent and flourishing jurisdiction for establishing offshore investment funds, generally. The BVI’s flexibility in offering alternative regulatory regimes for small to mid-sized hedge fund groups makes it an efficient proposition to establish investment managers and advisers in the BVI.</p>
  <p><strong>About the license</strong></p>
  <p>A BVI Approved fund is a low-cost hedge fund vehicle which allows a manager to bring together a small number of investors. This fund is cost-effective and designed to avoid the regulatory burden when establishing a small fund.</p>
  <p>This category of fund was introduced in 2015, under the Securities and Investment Business Regulations. They can either be created as such or be converted from a BVI Incubator Fund, which can only operate for a maximum of three years. BVI Approved Funds have the following characteristics:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Has no restriction on the minimum amount each investor subscribes.</li>
    <li>The total number of investors is limited to 20.</li>
    <li>Net assets of the Fund must not exceed US$100,000,000 or its equivalent in any other currency.</li>
    <li>Requires an Administrator and Authorised Representative to be appointed.</li>
    <li>No requirement for an auditor.</li>
    <li>No restriction on the life of the Fund.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>BVI Approved Funds benefits</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Low cost set up when compared to other jurisdictions, which is great for small to midsize funds</li>
    <li>There are no requirements for authorised capital or share capital, and depending on the Memorandum and Articles of Association, shares can be issued without par value.</li>
    <li>In terms of the regulatory regime, private equity and venture capital managers are subject to a somewhat “lighter” touch</li>
    <li>Good level of corporate governance and an accommodating corporate statute through the provisions of the BVI Business Companies Act</li>
    <li>Legislation in line with EU legislation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>BVI Incubator Fund</h2>
  <p>
    The BVI Incubator Fund is a start-up fund for those managers who want to keep costs in line
    until they have a track record to attract sufficient subscriptions to make the funds viable for the
    long term.
  </p>
  <p>
    The incubator fund is designed for managers who are looking to start an investment strategy on
    a trial basis with sophisticated investors. If the strategy succeeds within the prescribed
    timescale, the Regulations provide a seamless route for the fund to be recognised or approved
    as a private professional or approved fund, depending on the manager’s future plans for
    growth of the fund. If the strategy does not succeed, the regime allows for an incubator fund to
    close down or convert to an ordinary company. The incubator fund can exist and operate as
    such for up to two years with the option to extend for an additional year.
  </p>
  <p>
    An incubator fund can only accept 20 investors and has a minimum investment requirement of
    US$20,000 and a maximum cap on net assets of US$20M. In addition, an incubator fund is not
    required to appoint an auditor, administrator, custodian, investment manager, or auditor.
  </p>
  <h3>Benefits of BVI incubator fund</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>High level of corporate governance combined with a flexible corporate statute</li>
    <li>A ‘lighter-touch’ regulatory regime that is more welcoming to venture capital managers and private equity managers</li>
    <li>Suitable for smaller fund managers and those looking to build a track record</li>
    <li>A robust and efficient commercial court</li>
    <li>Competitive incorporation and running fees</li>
    <li>No need for a custodian</li>
    <li>No need for an offering document, only investor warnings, and investment strategy information</li>
    <li>Legislation in line with EU legislation</li>

  <h2>BVI Professional Fund</h2>
  <p>
    A Professional Fund is a mutual fund whose interests are made available only to professional
    investors and the initial investment of each investor (other than certain “exempted investors”) is
    not less than US$100,000.
  </p>
  <p>
    A BVI Professional Fund is the most popular type of BVI open-ended investment fund
    (approximately 70 per cent of all regulated funds in the jurisdiction). A professional investor is a
    person;
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>whose ordinary business involves, whether for that person’s own account or the account of others, the acquisition or disposal of property of the same kind as the property, or a substantial part of the property, of the Fund, or</li>
    <li>who has signed a declaration that the person, whether individually or jointly with such person’s spouse, has net worth in excess of US$1,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency) and that person consents to being treated as a professional investor.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    A Professional Fund may carry on business in the BVI for up to 21 days prior to obtaining
    recognition by the FSC, provided that the Professional Fund lodges an application for
    recognition with the FSC within 14 days of launch. The FSC may recognize a mutual fund as a
    Professional Fund if it is satisfied that the following qualifying criteria are met (“Recognition
    Requirements”).
  </p>
  <h3>Key features</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>No restriction on the number of investors that can be brought into the fund</li>
    <li>No AUM threshold</li>
    <li>Interests in a professional fund may only be issued to ‘professional investors’</li>
    <li>Minimum initial investment by each professional investor must not be less than US$100,000 (or other currency equivalent)</li>
    <li>An investor can be ‘exempted’, in which case there is no minimum initial investment</li>
    <li>For quick launch, it may carry on its business, or manage and administer its affairs, for a period of up to 21 days without being recognised by the FSC</li>
    <li>Possible to obtain an exemption from the requirement to audit financial statements</li>
    <li>Possible to obtain an exemption from requirement to appoint a custodian</li>
    <li>No requirement for local auditor sign-off</li>
    <li>A Professional Fund must not use the term “fund” or “mutual fund” or any derivative thereof in its name, unless the Professional Fund has obtained the prior written approval of the FSC and paid the requisite fee.</li>
    <li>A Professional Fund can make an application to the FSC for exemption from the requirement to appoint a (i) Custodian (ii) Manager, and/or (iii) Auditor. There is no exemption for a Professional Fund from the requirement to have an Administrator.</li>

  <p><strong>Cayman Islands Administered Fund</strong></p>
  <p>The Cayman Islands is one of the world’s leading offshore jurisdictions for the establishment of investment funds.</p>
  <p>The definition of a mutual fund, as established in the Mutual Funds Act, can be summarised as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A mutual fund is any company, trust or partnership either incorporated or established in the Cayman Islands, or if outside the Cayman Islands, managed from the Cayman Islands, which issues equity interest redeemable or repurchaseable at the option of the investor, the purpose of which is the pooling of investors’ funds with the aim of spreading investment risk and enabling investors to receive profits or gains from investments.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Mutual Funds Act (MFL) gives the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority responsibility for regulating certain categories of funds operating in and from the Cayman Islands.</p>
  <p><strong>Key features of the Cayman Islands as a jurisdiction for mutual funds include:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>The flexibility of the mutual funds regime within a clear and effective regulatory environment.</li>
    <li>The quality and experience of the legal, administrative and accounting service providers.</li>
    <li>Ease of registration procedures.</li>
    <li>No requirement to have Cayman Islands-based directors or officers, managers, administrators or custodians.</li>
    <li>No restriction on commercial matters such as investment objectives, trading strategies or leverage, trading or diversification limits. Such commercial matters are for the mutual fund’s sponsor to determine provided that full disclosure (and all associated risk factors) is made in the offering document.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>About Administered Fund</strong></p>
  <p>To be approved as an administered mutual fund, the fund must have a CIMA-licensed mutual fund administrator providing its principal office. The regulatory responsibility for the administered fund, which has more than 15 investors and which is not a licensed or registered mutual fund, is placed largely in the hands of a licensed Mutual Fund Administrator.</p>
  <p>An administered mutual fund is the only type of regulated mutual fund that must appoint a Cayman Islands licensed mutual fund administrator to provide its principal office in the Cayman Islands.</p>
  <p>For an administered mutual fund, the selected administrator, as principal office provider, undertakes the responsibility of being satisfied of the same matters that CIMA considers for a licensed fund.</p>
  <p><strong>Fund administrator</strong></p>
  <p>Mutual fund administration is defined as the management, including control of all or substantially all the assets of a mutual fund, or the administration of a mutual fund, or the provision of the principal office of the mutual fund in the Cayman Islands, or the provision of the operator (which is, as mentioned before, either the director, trustee or general partner) to a fund.</p>
  <p><strong>Categories of Mutual Fund Administrators</strong></p>
  <p>Currently, the Authority considers applications for the following types of Mutual Funds Administrators:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Full Administrators: Can perform administration to an unlimited number of mutual funds.</li>
    <li>Restricted Administrator: Can provide services for no more than 10 funds; must receive approval from the Authority for each fund for which they provide administration.</li>

  <h3>About Licensed Fund</h3>
  <p>A mutual fund may qualify to conduct business by obtaining a licence from the Authority pursuant to the provisions of the Act and having a registered office in the Cayman Islands (or if a unit trust – the trustee is appropriately licensed).</p>
  <p>The MFL specifies that a mutual fund operating in and from the Cayman Islands must have a licence unless: a licensed mutual fund administrator is providing its principal office; it meets the criteria set out in Section 4(3), which allows for funds to be registered, or it is exempt from regulation under Section 4(4).</p>
  <p>A fund promoter manager would usually choose to licence a fund under the MF Act if the fund is intended to be a retail fund offered generally to the public outside the Cayman Islands, with its administrator and/or manager and other key service providers located outside the Cayman Islands. The provisions relating to licensed mutual funds benefit large, well known and reputable institutions, which do not propose to appoint Cayman Islands service providers.</p>

  <h2>Cayman Islands Registered Fund</h2>
  <p>
    The Cayman Islands is one of the world’s leading offshore jurisdictions for the establishment of investment funds. The definition of a mutual fund, as established in the Mutual Funds Act, can be summarised as follows: A mutual fund is any company, trust, or partnership either incorporated or established in the Cayman Islands, or if outside the Cayman Islands, managed from the Cayman Islands, which issues equity interest redeemable or repurchaseable at the option of the investor, the purpose of which is the pooling of investors’ funds with the aim of spreading investment risk and enabling investors to receive profits or gains from investments. The Mutual Funds Act (MFL) gives the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority responsibility for regulating certain categories of funds operating in and from the Cayman Islands.
  </p>
  <h3>Key features of the Cayman Islands as a jurisdiction for mutual funds include:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>The flexibility of the mutual funds regime within a clear and effective regulatory environment.</li>
    <li>The quality and experience of the legal, administrative, and accounting service providers.</li>
    <li>Ease of registration procedures.</li>
    <li>No requirement to have Cayman Islands-based directors or officers, managers, administrators, or custodians.</li>
    <li>No restriction on commercial matters such as investment objectives, trading strategies or leverage, trading or diversification limits. Such commercial matters are for the mutual fund’s sponsor to determine provided that full disclosure (and all associated risk factors) is made in the offering document.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>About Registered Fund</h3>
  <p>
    This is by far the most popular type of regulated mutual fund, comprising around 97% of all such funds. A mutual fund may qualify to conduct business by simply registering as such with the Authority on the basis that:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The minimum initial investment per investor in the fund is at least US$100,000 (CI$82,000) or the equivalent;</li>
    <li>The shares, units or other interests in the fund are listed on a recognised stock exchange; or</li>
    <li>The equity interests are held by not more than fifteen investors, a majority of whom are capable of appointing or removing the operator of the fund.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Master funds</h3>
  <p>
    Master funds are a sub-category of registered funds. The master-feeder fund structure is popular for drawing in investment funds from different jurisdictions and consolidating them in one central investment platform. Particularly useful at adapting to country-specific regulations, master-feeders are flexible and efficient vehicles for raising financing for investment internationally.
  </p>
  <p>
    A master fund is defined as “a company, partnership or unit trust that; a) is established or incorporated in Cayman; b) issues equity interest to one or more investors; c) holds investments and conducts trading activities for the principal purpose of implementing the overall investment strategy of the regulated feeder fund and d) has one or more regulated feeder funds either directly or through an intermediary entity established to invest in the master fund.” A regulated feeder fund is defined as “a regulated mutual fund that conducts more than 51% of its investing in a master fund either directly or through an intermediary entity”.

    <h2>Dubai Qualified Investor Fund (QIF) License</h2>
    <p>Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) is one of the world’s top ten onshore financial centers and offers a secure and efficient platform for businesses and financial institutions to reach into and out of the emerging markets of the region. The quality and independence of DIFC’s regulator, the prevailing common law framework, excellent infrastructure, and tax efficiencies make it the perfect base to take advantage of the rapidly growing demand for financial and business services in the MENASA region. The DFSA is the independent regulator of financial and ancillary services conducted in or from the DIFC, responsible for managing or distributing Collective Investment Funds (Funds).</p>
    
    <h3>About the license</h3>
    <p>Qualified Investor Funds are open only to Professional Clients (as defined by the DIFC). The other features of a QIF in the DIFC are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Minimum subscription of US$ 500,000;</li>
        <li>Can have only 50 or fewer unit-holders; and</li>
        <li>Units are offered to persons only by way of a Private Placement.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Fund manager</h3>
    <p>One of the main requirements to incorporate a QIF is to have a Fund Manager. A Fund Manager is the person who is legally accountable to the unitholders for the management of the Fund, including the property held for or within the Fund (“Fund Property”), and who establishes, manages, or otherwise operates or winds up the fund. A person who performs this financial service in the DIFC must obtain from the DFSA the regulatory permission of ‘Managing a Collective Investment Fund’.</p>
    <p>To establish and manage a Fund in the DIFC you need to be either:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A DFSA-licensed Fund Manager; or</li>
        <li>An External Fund Manager</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>A Domestic Fund Manager</strong> is a Fund Manager who is incorporated in the DIFC and is licensed and regulated by the DFSA to provide the financial service of managing a CIF. A Domestic Fund Manager is licensed by the DFSA to operate the Fund and can provide this financial service to either Domestic or Foreign Funds.</p>
    <p><strong>An External Fund Manager</strong> is a Foreign Fund Manager who is permitted to establish and manage a Domestic Fund in the DIFC without having to establish a place of business in the DIFC. The External Fund Manager must be subject to regulation by a Financial Services Regulator in a Recognised Jurisdiction (as defined by the DFSA) and subject itself to the DIFC laws and jurisdiction of the DIFC courts. The External Fund Manager must appoint a Fund Administrator or Trustee in the DIFC to act as its agent in its dealings with the DFSA, Unitholders, and prospective Unitholders.</p>

  <h2>Mauritius Closed End Fund (CEF) License</h2>
  <p>
    A Mutual Fund pools together money from different investors, which is then used to invest in a variety of asset classes, such as shares, bonds and real estate. The fund is managed by a professional fund manager, who allocates the fund’s assets according to a predefined strategy, with the aim of generating capital gains or income for investors. The fund manager selects and buys a variety of securities and these are then split into equal units which are sold to investors. Investment Funds and their Intermediaries (CIS Managers, CIS Administrators and Custodians) are regulated by the FSC under the Securities Act 2005 and the Securities (Collective Investment Schemes and Closed-End Funds) Regulations 2008, which provide for a consolidated regulatory and supervisory framework.
  </p>
  <h3>About Closed End Fund</h3>
  <p>
    Closed-end funds are defined under Mauritius laws as arrangements or schemes, other than a collective investment scheme, constituted in such legal form as may be approved by the Commission and whose object is to invest funds, collected from subscribers during an offering made under Part V of the Securities Act or from sophisticated investors, in a portfolio of securities, or in other financial or non-financial assets, or real property, as may be approved by the Commission.
  </p>
  <p>
    Key features of Closed End Fund include:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Closed-ended funds have a fixed number of shares or units issued during the fund’s initial offering.</li>
    <li>Investors cannot redeem or purchase additional units directly from the fund; instead, they must buy or sell existing units on the secondary market.</li>
    <li>The market price of closed-ended funds may differ from their Net Asset Value due to supply and demand dynamics.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Investment Funds’ Intermediaries, CIS Managers, Custodians and CIS Administrators, ensure the proper functioning of the CIS/CEF and have to undergo a rigorous assessment during the licensing process. Once licensed, the FSC continually monitors the intermediaries for compliance with supervisory, prudential and conduct of business norms as per the CIS Regulations.
  </p>

  <h2>Mauritius Expert Funds License</h2>
  <p>A Mutual Fund pools together money from different investors, which is then used to invest in a variety of asset classes, such as shares, bonds and real estate. The fund is managed by a professional fund manager, who allocates the fund’s assets according to a predefined strategy, with the aim of generating capital gains or income for investors. The fund manager selects and buys a variety of securities and these are then split into equal units which are sold to investors. Investment Funds and their Intermediaries (CIS Managers, CIS Administrators and Custodians) are regulated by the FSC under the Securities Act 2005 and the Securities (Collective Investment Schemes and Closed-End Funds) Regulations 2008, which provide for a consolidated regulatory and supervisory framework.</p>

  <p>In terms of the Regulations, Collective Investment Schemes can be broken down into the following categories:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Regulated Global Collective Investment Schemes</li>
    <li>Professional Collective Investment Schemes</li>
    <li>Specialized Collective Investment Schemes</li>
    <li>Expert Fund</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>About Expert Funds</strong></p>
  <p>Collective Investment Scheme can apply to the FSC to be authorized as an Expert Fund based on the condition that the scheme is only available to expert investors.</p>
  <p>The Regulations define an “expert investor” as either:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>An investor that makes minimum initial investment for his own account in an amount of not less than USD 100,000</li>
    <li>A Sophisticated Investor as defined by the Securities Act</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The investment manager of an Expert Fund either needs to hold a Collective Investment Scheme Managers Licence or must hold a licence issued by a regulator in a jurisdiction having comparable regulation as Mauritius for investor protection. An expert fund is exempted from several provisions of the Securities regulations.</p>

  <p><strong>Recognition of Foreign Schemes</strong></p>
  <p>The FSC may also recognize, under Section 101 of the Securities Act 2005, a CIS established in a foreign country subject to such conditions as the FSC considers necessary for the protection of participants in the CIS.</p>

  <p><strong>Investment Funds’ Intermediaries</strong></p>
  <p>The Intermediaries, CIS Managers, Custodians and CIS Administrators, ensure the proper functioning of the CIS/CEF and have to undergo a rigorous assessment during the licensing process. Once licensed, the FSC continually monitors the intermediaries for compliance with supervisory, prudential and conduct of business norms as per the CIS Regulations.</p>

  <h2>THE ADVANTAGES OF MAURITIUS</h2>

  <h2>Panama Private Investment Fund (PIF-20 up to 20 investors) or (20-FP)</h2>
  <p>
    Private investment fund is a company incorporated for the purpose of doing specific
    investments on behalf of its shareholders, and that does not solicit capital from retail investors
    or the general public, unless as specifically allowed in the local securities laws, which usually
    refers to qualified investors.
  </p>
  <p>
    The operation of a Panama Private Fund is governed by Decree-Law No.1 of July 8, 1999 (the
    “Securities Act”) together with Regulation No.5 of July 23, 2004 (the “Regulations”) issued by
    the Superintendency of the Securities Market (the “SSM”), which is the government body
    responsible for regulating funds in Panama.
  </p>
  <h3>Advantages of a Panama Fund</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Once a private fund is established there is no requirement to register with, or notify the
      Superintendency of the Securities Market. Additionally, this type of private fund is not
      required to comply with the provisions of the Regulations of a 50-FP</li>
    <li>There is no restriction on the type of assets the private fund can invest in</li>
    <li>The directors of the private fund do not need to be based in Panama</li>
    <li>If the private fund holds assets locally in Panama it may require additional regulations
      in Panama</li>
    <li>A private fund of up to 20 investors does not need an auditor, a custodian or investment
      manager</li>
    <li>A 20-FP has a very light regulatory touch in Panama and can be established relatively
      quickly and cost effectively</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>About the license</h3>
  <p>
    The fund is limited to 20 investors maximum, investors which should be related to each other
    by their belonging to a company, association, or group. The shares of this fund can also not be
    commercialized, distributed, or publicly offered. The article also includes another exception to
    the rule, which is corporations in which shares were emitted in virtue of a contract between
    participants, prohibiting the entrance of new shareholders. Under these two exceptions, the
    fund will not need to: 1. Register with the SMV (Superintendence of Securities), 2. Be supervised
    by the SMV or 3. Notify them of the beginning of your operations.

The Seychelles Mutual Fund and Hedge Fund Act 2007 defines a “mutual fund” as a company, unit trust or partnership that collects and pools funds for collective investment purposes including hedge fund purposes or with the aim of spreading investment risks, and issues equity interests enabling investors in the mutual fund to receive or have the right to receive a portion of profits or gains derived from the investments and includes:</p>
  <p>a) an umbrella fund whose equity interests are split or segregated into different funds or sub funds and<br/>b) a hedge fund.” An “equity interest” means a share, trust unit or partnership that<br/>a) carries an entitlement to participate in the profits or gains of the company, unit trust or partnership; and<br/>b) is redeemable or re-purchasable at the option of the investor before commencement of the winding-up, termination or dissolution of the company, unit trust or partnership, but does not include a debt.</p>
  
  <h2>About the license</h2>
  <p>The Act defines a Public Fund simply as a mutual fund which is not a Private or a Professional Fund. The Fund is designed to be mass marketed and needs to provide the detailed information to public in the offering document.</p>
  
  <h2>Advantages of Seychelles Mutual Funds</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Seychelles licensed funds are exempted from taxes on total fund’s income. They are also exempt from withholding tax and stamp duty.</li>
    <li>Umbrella funds are allowed (i.e., a fund that invests in a range of different fund or sub-funds).</li>
    <li>A broad range of fund vehicle options are available to choose from. E.g., IBC (International Business Company), CSL (Special License Company), Trust, and PCC (Protected Cell Company).</li>
    <li>Mutual fund in Seychelles can be administered in Seychelles by a Seychelles Licensed fund administrator or outside of Seychelles by approved foreign administrator.</li>

  <h2>Vanuatu Mutual Funds</h2>
  <p>Per the definition of the Mutual Fund Act, a mutual fund;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Means a company, a unit trust or a partnership that issues equity interests, the purpose or effect of which is the pooling of investors’ fund with the aim of spreading investments risks; and</li>
    <li>Enabling investors in the mutual fund to receive profits or gains from the acquisition, holding, management or disposal of investments, but does not include a bank within the meaning of the Financial Institution Act [CAP 254] or the International Banking Act [CAP 280], an insurer within the meaning of the Insurance Act No 54 of 2005.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Vanuatu has revamped the Mutual Funds Act in 2005 to offer a competitive edge to established Mutual Funds and administrators in the world of onerous compliance and suffocating regulations of their jurisdiction’s regulators.</p>
  
  <p>The Act has provisions to protect investors by allowing only licensed mutual funds to operate, and by requiring administrators of mutual funds to be licensed. Mutual fund administrators must apply for a Representation License simultaneously with the Mutual Fund License Application.</p>
  
  <p>The Vanuatu Financial Services Commission administers the licensing regime. The Act gives the Commission powers to effectively supervise the operation of mutual funds.</p>
  
  <h3>Types of Mutual Funds</h3>
  <p>The Act makes a distinction between 2 main types of funds:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Foreign mutual fund</li>
    <li>General mutual fund</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>The Act also makes provision for those who administer the above mutual fund in or from within Vanuatu to hold a mutual fund administrator license.</p>
  
  <h3>Foreign Mutual Fund</h3>
  <p>A Foreign Mutual Fund License is a mutual fund that is constituted outside Vanuatu and operates in Vanuatu. A Foreign Mutual Fund licence may be issued to the administrator of a foreign mutual fund if:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>If the fund promoter is of sound reputation; and</li>
    <li>The fund will have a mutual fund administrator in Vanuatu that will be providing an office in Vanuatu for the fund.</li>
    <li>That the fund’s administrator will at all times keep an office in Vanuatu for the fund.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>General Mutual Fund</h3>
  <p>A General Mutual Fund license may be issued to the promoter of a general mutual fund if:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Each promoter of the fund is of sound reputations; and</li>
    <li>The fund will have a mutual fund administrator in Vanuatu that be providing an office in Vanuatu for the fund; and</li>
    <li>The arrangements for the administration of the fund are otherwise satisfactory; and</li>
    <li>If the fund is a company, the fund must at least have two directors and the rules prohibit the Issue of bearer shares;</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>A mutual fund administrator can be:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>a company incorporated in Vanuatu and registered under the Companies Act No 25 of 2012; or</li>
    <li>a overseas company incorporated outside Vanuatu whether or not it is registered under Part 10 of the Companies Act No 25 of 2012</li>
    <li>a Limited partnership within the meaning of the Partnership Act [CAP 92]; or</li>
    <li>a partnership constituted for the sole purpose of undertaking the administration of mutual funds.</li>
